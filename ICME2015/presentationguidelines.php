<h1>Presentation Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Oral Presentation Guidelines</h2>
<p align="justify">Each full paper in an oral session is allocated <strong> 18 minutes</strong>. 
This includes time for questions from the audience, session-chair introductions and any set up that is not completed in 
advance. To achieve appropriate timing, organize your slides around the points you intend to 
make, using no more than one slide per minute. Be prepared to begin your presentation as 
soon as the prior presenter has finished; it is important to keep on schedule.</p>

<p align="justify">Your presentation can be uploaded on the conference center facilities 
  (both PDF and PPT file formats are allowed with preference for PDF to avoid font issues). 
  For the main conference oral presentations the upload must be done through the Slide Center 
  that will be opened for all the duration of the conference. Workshop oral presentation can be uploaded directly on the PC (MS Windows OS) 
  available in each lecture room.  As an alternative you can use your own laptop with the VGA connection available in each lecture 
  room (bring with you proper adaptor if your laptop does not have VGA plug). It is recommended to test the 
  presentation materials, e.g. video and audio, as well as your laptop in advance of the session to ensure compatibility. 
  It is a good idea to have your presentation material on a memory stick as a backup even if you plan to use your own laptop. 
  Each room will have personnel that can help to provide technical support
</p>
 
<p align="justify">Presenters are requested to be present in the room at least 10 minutes before the start of their session and introduce themselves to the session chair.</p>


<h2><a name="guideposter"></a>Poster Presentation Guidelines</h2>
<p align="justify">Authors need to stand by their posters during the sessions which enable presenters to discuss research and development with the audience and to gain feedback as well as to establish 
potential contacts.</p>

<p align="justify">Posters should be prepared using <strong> A0</strong> paper size with <strong>portrait orientation</strong> as shown in the table:</p>

<table border="1" style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Poster Size</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Width x Height (mm)</strong></td>		
    <td><strong>Width x Height (in)</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>A0</strong></td>
    <td>841 x 1189 mm</td>		
    <td>33.1 x 46.8 in</td>
  </tr>
 </table>



<p align="justify">In each poster session, posters are assigned unique poster ID, which should match the poster locations. Please put up your poster during the break before your session starts, and take it 
down immediately after your session ends. A presenter must be present at your poster for all 
the session duration. If possible, more than one author should attend the session to aid in 
presentations and discussions, and to provide the presenters with the chance to rest or briefly 
view other posters. Prepare a short presentation of about 5 or 10 minutes that you can 
periodically give to those assembled around your poster throughout the poster session. If you 
need extra presentation materials, such as a video display or computer, you are required to 
bring them yourself; note that any equipment used in the poster area should be battery-
operated, since power will not be provided on the floor.</p>


<h2>Demo Presentation Guidelines</h2>

<p align="justify">The presenter is to be stationed by his/her demo, show the demonstration, and answer
questions from audiences. Presenters are encouraged to engage the audiences in discussion. 
The presenters are to report to the Session Chairs and set up their demos before the start of 
the session. All demos must be dismantled after the demo session.</p>

<p align="justify">Demonstrators are required to bring their own computing equipment and any additional 
network, display, sensor, etc. hardware needed for the demonstration. All presenters will be 
provided with a place for their demos, a table (120 cm x 60 cm), poster board (see Poster 
presentation above for size), Internet access (conference shared wi-fi only) and a power 
outlet (230 V 50Hz, see Italian power plug details <a href="http://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/italy/">here</a>).</p>
