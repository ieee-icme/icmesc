<h2>Industry Forum: MPEG Media Transport (MMT)</h2>

For instance, there is a greater demand for flexible and partial access to media content. Recognizing the new challenges and shortcomings of existing standards, MPEG initiated the development of new standards for improved multimedia delivery over the Internet. MPEG Media Transport (MMT) was developed as part 1 of ISO/IEC 23008, High Efficiency Coding and Media Delivery in Heterogeneous Environments (MPEG-H). MMT has published to be IS stage in June, 2014.
