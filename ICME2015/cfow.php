<h1> Call For Ongoing Works</h1>
<h2>IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME 2015)</h2>
<p>June 29 - July 3, 2015 &#8226; TURIN, Italy</p>

<p align="justify">The goal of the On-Going Work Track is to present research that is not mature enough to warrant a full paper (e.g., experimental results not fully complete, integration with other system elements not done yet, and so on), but which would be of interest to the general multimedia community, granting early exposure to a large community. </p>

<p align="justify">Authors are invited to submit 2-page On-Going Work descriptions, using the prescribed template (see below), in all application areas identified in the ICME 2015 call for papers. Only electronic submissions will be accepted through the CMT online system under the “On-Going Work track”. On-going Work descriptions will be selected on the basis of their technical quality and their potential interest for ICME 2015 attendees. Accepted works will be presented in a specific poster session during the ICME 2015 main program, and they will be included in the USB Proceedings (with a dedicated ISBN) but they will not appear in IEEE Xplore. Please note that authors of On-Going Works will be free to submit their completed work to other venues as these will not be permanently archived and as such there will be no self‐plagiarism issues.</p>
