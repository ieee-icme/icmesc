<p align="justify">IEEE International Conference on Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. It serves as a forum to promote the exchange of the latest advances in multimedia technologies, systems, and applications from both the research and development perspectives of the circuits and systems, communications, computer, and signal processing communities. An Exposition of multimedia products, animations and industries will be held in conjunction with the conference.</p>

<p align="justify">The goal of the demonstration sessions is to allow members of the multimedia community an opportunity to demonstrate working multimedia systems. This environment allows conference participants to view demonstrations firsthand in a manner not possible in a traditional technical talk or poster session, and provides invaluable experiences for them to appreciate the research work. This year, <strong>the demonstration sessions will be merged with the poster sessions</strong>, and every accepted technical paper (oral or poster) at ICME will be provided with space and Internet access to show a demo beside their presentation. Although the demo is optional, we highly encourage authors to bring their demos to showcase their work. The authors are required to provide their own computing equipment and any additional network, display, haptic, sensor, etc., hardware needed for the demonstration.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition, <strong>we request proposals for demonstrations</strong> from anyone in the multimedia community, including researchers, academic institutions, research labs, and industry. Submissions are encouraged in all areas related to multimedia. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to 3D multimedia and immersive technologies, novel computer-human interfaces, haptics, wireless multimedia applications, multimedia-based security applications (including digital rights management), content analysis, contentbased retrieval, multimedia databases, multimedia networking, multimedia authoring, media rich social networks, rich media advertising, etc.</p>

<p align="justify">The demo proposals will NOT be double blind, but they will still be reviewed by the organization committee to ensure quality. The accepted demo proposals will be included in the ICME USB/CD proceedings, but will not be included in IEEE Xplore. Demonstrators will be provided with the same equipment as poster authors, and eligible for the best demo awards.</p>
