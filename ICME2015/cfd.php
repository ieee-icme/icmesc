<p align="justify">The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. </p>

<p align="justify">Authors are invited to submit 2-page demo papers using the prescribed template, describing the content of the demonstration and indicating the proposed form of the presentation. Demo submission can be accompanied with multimedia attachments of up to 10 MB. Only electronic submissions will be accepted through the CMT online system under the “Demo track”. Note that accepted demo papers and any supplementary multimedia attachments will only be included in the USB Proceedings (with a dedicated ISBN) and not appear in IEEE Xplore.</p>
