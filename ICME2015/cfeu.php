<p align="justify">The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. </p>

<p> The EU-Projects Program aims at increasing awareness of the scientific and industrial community that attend ICME 2015 of the recent results obtained by Research Projects funded by the European Commission or by European Agencies (included those supported by a single member state). At the same time the Program allows project coordinators and partners to disseminate the developed approaches and results.</p>


<p align="justify">Project Coordinators or project partners are invited to submit papers (with a maximum length of 4 pages) using the conference templates available at <a href="/files/cameraready.zip"><u>here</u></a>, describing their project, the developed approaches and the obtained results. The submitted paper will be reviewed following the same procedure as workshop papers, where novelty, impact on the citizen needs, presentation quality and experimental validation will be considered. Accepted papers will be included in the USB Proceedings of the ICME 2015 Workshops Program and will be also available to the general public through IEEE-Xplore.</p>

<p align="justify">The accepted papers will be presented during a specific ICME 2015 poster session. During the poster session paper authors will have space to show project demos.</p>
