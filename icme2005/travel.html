<p>
Amsterdam, the capital of The Netherlands, is a small city by European
standards (population 750.000) but one of the most charming and delightful
towns of Europe. It possesses the largest historical inner city of Europe,
with beautiful monumental buildings and an extensive web of canals. The city
can easily be explored on foot: museums, theatres, shopping streets, monuments,
open air markets and most other features of interest are generally within walking
distance of one another. The city is famous for its 17th century canals: a boat
trip along the canals is a special experience. Amsterdam is one of the leading
cultural centres of Europe, with a high concentration of famous museums,
including the Rijksmuseum, the Stedelijk Museum, the Van Gogh Museum and the
Anne Frank House. Other cultural attractions include the Diamantslijperijen
(diamond cutting establishments) and the Rembrandt House.
