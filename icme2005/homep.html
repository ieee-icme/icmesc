IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) is a major annual
international conference organized with the objective of bringing together
researchers, developers and practitioners from academia and industry working
in all areas of multimedia. ICME serves as a forum for the dissemination of
state-of-the-art research, development, and implementations of multimedia
systems, technologies, and applications. ICME is co-sponsored by four
IEEE societies (the Computer Society, the Signal Processing Society,
the Circuits and Systems Society, and the IEEE Communications Society).
