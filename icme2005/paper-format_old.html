<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><i>Paper Submission Format</i></b></p>
</font>

<p>A complete paper must be submitted in camera-ready format with no more than
  4 pages in length.</font></b></p>

  <p>The paper format must follow the standard IEEE 2-column format of
  single-spaced text in 10 point Times Roman (or closely resembling), with 12
  point interline space. All printed material, including illustrations, must be
  kept within a print area of 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.6
  cm) high. The guidelines below&nbsp; may assist you in meeting this format.</p>

  <p>Please note that <font color="#FF0000"><b>ICME does not allow dual
  submissions to other conferences</b></font>. If such submissions are discovered, papers
  will be removed from the conference even though they have been accepted.</p>

  <h2><span style="font-size: 14pt">Guidelines</span></h2>
<P class="Level2">LENGTH: You are allowed a total of 4 pages for your document. This is the maximum number of pages that will be accepted, including all figures, tables, and references. Any documents that exceed the 4 page limit will be rejected.
</P>
<P class="Level2">LANGUAGE: All proposals must be in English.
</P>
<P class="Level2">MARGINS: Documents should be formatted for standard <B>letter-size (8-1/2" by 11") paper</B>. Documents may not exceed four (4) pages. Any text or other material outside the margins specified below will not be accepted:
	<UL>
		<LI>All text and figures must be contained in a 175 mm x 226 mm (6.9 inch x 8.9 inch) image area.</LI>
		<LI>The left margin must be 19 mm (0.75 inch).</LI>
		<LI>The top margin must be 25 mm (1.0 inch), except for the title page where it must be 35 mm (1.375 inches).</LI>
		<LI>Text should appear in two columns, each 83 mm wide with 8 mm space between columns.</LI>
		<LI>On the first page, the top 50 mm (2") of both columns is reserved for the title, author(s), and affiliation(s). These items should be centered across both columns, starting at 35 mm (1.375 inches) from the top of the page.</LI>
		<LI>The paper abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of text, about 12 mm (0.5") below the title area and no more than 80 mm (3.125") in length. Leave 12 mm (0.5") of space between the end of the abstract and the beginning of the main text.</LI>
	</UL>
	A format sheet with the margins and placement guides is available in the following file formats:
	<UL>
		<LI><A href="PaperFormat/format.pdf">PDF file</A> (Most Accurate. When you print this file, make sure the "shrink to fit" box is not checked!)</LI>
		<LI><A href="PaperFormat/format.ps">PostScript file</A></LI>
	</UL>
	These files contain lines and boxes showing the margins and print areas. If you print one of these files, then stack it atop your printed page and hold it up to the light, you can easily check your margins to see if your print area fits within the space allowed.
</P>
<P class="Level2">TYPEFACE: To achieve the best viewing experience for the review process and conference proceedings, we strongly encourage authors to use Times-Roman font. If a font face is used that is not recognized by the submission system, your proposal will not be reproduced correctly. Use a font size that is no smaller than 9 points throughout the proposal, including figure captions. In 9-point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high. For 9-point type font, there should be no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically. This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make the proposal much more readable. Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger vertical spacing.
</P>
<P class="Level2">TITLE: The paper title has to appear in boldface CAPITAL letters. The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower case letters. Proposals with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information.
</P>
<P class="Level2">ABSTRACT: Each paper should contain an abstract of 100 to 150 words that appears at the beginning of the document. Use the same text that is submitted electronically along with the author contact information.
</P>
<P class="Level2">BODY: Major headings appear in boldface CAPITAL letters, centered in the column. Subheadings appear in capital and lower case, either underlined or in boldface. They start at the left margin of the column on a separate line. Sub-subheadings are discouraged, but if they must be used, they should appear in capital and lower case, and start at the left margin on a separate line. They may be underlined or in italics.
</P>
<P class="Level2">REFERENCES: List and number all references at the end of the document. The references can be numbered in alphabetical order or in order of appearance in the paper. When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence [1].  The end of the document should include a list of references containing information similar to the following example:
</P>
<P class="Level3">[1] D. E. Ingalls, "Image Processing for Experts," IEEE Trans. ASSP, vol. ASSP-36, pp. 1932-1948, 1988.
</P>
<P class="Level2">ILLUSTRATIONS &amp; COLOR: Illustrations must appear within the designated margins. They may span the two columns. If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in the middle or at the bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must be clear in black and white. Since the printed proceedings will be produced in black and white, be sure that your images are acceptable when printed in black and white (the CDROM proceedings will show the colors in your document).
</P>
<P class="Level2">PAGE NUMBERS: <B>Do not put page numbers on your document</B>. We will add appropriate page numbers to accepted papers when the conference proceedings are assembled.
</P>
<P>The following style files and templates are available for users of LaTeX and Microsoft Word:
<UL>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/spconf.sty">LaTeX style file with margin, page layout, font, etc. definitions.</A></LI>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/IEEEbib.bst">BiBTeX style file with bibliography style definitions.</A></LI>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/Template.tex">LaTeX template file, an example of using the "spconf.sty" and "IEEEbib.bst" files above.</A></LI>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/WordTemplate.doc">Word 97/2000 Sample, a template of correct formatting and font use.</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>We recommend that you use the Word file or LaTeX files to produce your document, since they have been set up to meet the formatting guidelines listed above.  When using these files, double-check the paper size in your page setup to make sure you are using the letter-size paper layout (8.5" X 11").  The LaTeX environment files specify suitable margins, page layout, text, and a bibliography style. Although this environment has been extensively tested, there may be rare instances when it is not fully robust.
