<h1>T-1: Distributed Video Coding for Low Cost Multimedia Communications and Systems</h1>

<h3>Monday Morning, June 23, 09:30 - 12:30</h3>

<h3>Presented by</h3>

<p>W.A.C. Fernando, <em>University of Surrey</em></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Video Coding technologies have evolved tremendously over past decades in line
  with the rapidly increasing demand over vastly expanding application domains.
  The research on video coding has been traditionally dominated by the work on
  MPEG and ITU-T H.26x standardisations based systems. It is known that in these
  mainstream technologies the video encoders are far more complex (by approximately
  5 to 10 times) than the decoder structure. This architecture was motivated
  by many of the conventional one-to-many type video applications including broadcasting
  (DVB), video streaming etc where the decoder cost need to maintained considerably
  low for the benefit of large numbers of viewers compared to the limited number
  of content providers. However, more recently, this architecture is challenged
  by new consumer applications where the cost of encoder is a prime concern due
  to the necessity of vast deployments of video sensors. Security surveillance
  systems, mobile video conferencing, monitoring of the disabled people and children,
  disaster zone monitoring are a few potential scenarios which are largely benefited
  by massive encoder deployments. Distributed Video Coding (DVC) is an emerging
  video coding technology designed with a modified complexity balance between
  the encoder and decoder in line with the necessities of these applications.
  The dramatically low complexity of the DVC encoder helps these solutions by:
  (i) reducing the production cost of the signal processors of the video sensors,
  (ii) reducing the requirement of digital memory and (iii) reducing the power
  consumption which is generally a scarce resource at remote sites.</p>
<p>The research
  on DVC is still in preliminary stages and considerable amount of effort is
  necessary before going through the standardisation process and commercial use.
  The currently available literatures have used a number of hypothetical models
  and assumptions some of which have not yet been assessed for practical viability.
  Key frame transmission algorithm, noise distribution and error estimation at
  the decoder, implementation of the reverse feedback channel using the dynamic
  error estimation and the necessary communication protocols are some of the
  major open areas for research in DVC. Side information generation is an area
  largely discussed in literature, yet further room for development.</p>
<p>In DVC,
  the shift of complexity balance is achieved by moving the major task of the
  exploitation of source correlations to achieve the compression into the decoder.
  This task involves the generation of estimation, called side information, for
  the Wyner-Ziv frames of the video sequence. A sequence of ‘selected’ original
  frames is generally passed to the decoder using an intra frame coding scheme
  and are called key-frames. The frequency of key-frame transmission could vary
  on the DVC implementation strategy as determined by the Group of Picture (GOP)
  size. Different techniques have been proposed for the side information estimation
  ranging from simple frame interpolation/extrapolation through more complex
  and accurate motion estimation and compensation techniques. In DVC, the estimated
  side information is modelled with the original Wyner-Ziv frame and an additive
  white noise (AWN) term. The quantification of the statistical distribution
  properties of this hypothetical noise is a part of the ongoing research activity.
  The side information is used for decoding with the parity bit stream transmitted
  over the channel from the encoder. At the encoder this parity bits are generated
  by passing the original video sequence through a turbo encoder. This parity
  bit sequence is generally subjected to puncturing. Parity puncturing and the
  quantisation are the primary mechanisms for the video compression in DVC. Transform
  coding (e.g DCT) has been proposed for improving the compression efficiency
  of DVC, even though the DCT algorithm somewhat compromises the extremely low
  complexity in the pixel domain DVC encoder structure.</p>
<p>DVC makes use of, and
  operates within the theoretical framework and guidelines of distributed source
  coding set in the Slepian-Wolf theorem and the current DVC implementations
  are based in the Wyner-Ziv model. According to Wyner-Ziv model, the maximum
  compression efficiency is limited by the level of correlations between the
  side information (estimated) and the original Wyner-Ziv frame information and
  hence the main focus in DVC research is the design of accurate estimation algorithms.</p>
<p>In
  this tutorial we will discuss the motivations behind the DVC design, basic
  DVC codec architectures, current DVC codec architectures and possible modifications
  to enhance the performance, the hypothetical models and assumptions used in
  the current design together with design criteria for possible practical solutions
  and some of the potential application domains. Outline of the tutorial</p>
