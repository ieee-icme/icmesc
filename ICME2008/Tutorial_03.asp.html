<h1>T-3: Learning Human Perception and Semantics Understanding in Multimedia
  Applications</h1>

<h3>Monday Morning, June 23, 09:30 - 12:30</h3>

<h3>Presented by</h3>
<p>Cha Zhang, <em>Microsoft Research</em> and Tsuhan Chen, <em>Carnegie Mellon
    University</em></p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Human has always been considered one of the most important factors in multimedia
  applications. However, the high level human understanding of scenes/events
  and perception are very hard to model with traditional signal processing techniques.
  Recently, data-driven, machine learning based methods have attracted more and
  more attention. Compared with traditional algorithms, data-driven learning
  methods rely on training examples instead of accurate modeling of semantics
  and perception, which have been shown to be very effective for various applications.
  For instance, in early works for image retrieval, similarity between images
  are often computed based on low level features, which is often insufficient
  to model the semantic distance. Recent machine learning methods can instead
  recognize objects in images, making semantic distance computation much more
  feasible. Another example is image/video enhancement. While traditional image
  enhancement methods such as image equalization are very popular, they are not
  directly linked with human perception, and hence may not always produce good
  results. Instead, if a certain set of good-looking images can be provided,
  better results could be obtained via machine learning methods.</p>
<p>In this 3 hour
  tutorial, we give a brief introduction on some popular machine learning methods,
  and show how these machine learning methods can be applied in multimedia applications
  to learn semantics and human perception. In particular, we present schemes
  to enhance low quality videos by learning from professionally taken celebrity
  images, to relight human faces by learning from illumination data sets, to
  discover objects in image/videos by examining similar objects in a large database,
  to detect active speakers by learning cues from both audio/visual information,
  etc. Our goal is to provide multimedia researchers a set of new tools and a
  new perspective for solving their daily research issues. The target audiences
  for the tutorial are graduate students who are interested in machine learning,
  or scientist who are interested in learning how to apply machine learning methods
  to multimedia applications.</p>
