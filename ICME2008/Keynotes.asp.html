<h3>Cars that Drive Themselves<br />
Tuesday Morning, June 24</h3>

<p class="name">Sebastian Thrun</p>

<p>This talk will introduce the audience of the ICME into the fascinating
world of robotics cars. Most of us use cars in our daily lives; yet
cars are inefficient, unsafe, and environmentally wasteful. Robotic
technology promises to overcome some of these shortcomings, by making
cars safer; drivers more productive; and also by reducing the burden
to the environment by enabling new models of car sharing. Thrun will
present Stanford's research on the basic artificial intelligence
behind this new emerging technology. In particular, he will report
from two recent autonomous car competitions, organized by DARPA, and
dubbed "Grand Challenge" and "Urban Challenge." Machine perception,
computer vision, machine learning, and probabilistic computation all
play major roles in the design of these systems. Thrun will shed light
onto the inner workings of these robots, and discuss the impact of
self-driving cars on society once the technology is sufficiently
matured.</p>

<p><strong>Sebastian Thrun</strong> is a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Thrun's research focuses on
Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Thrun is probably best known for
his victory in the DARPA Grand Challenge, and his second place finish
in the DARPA Urban Challenge - both robotic competition organized by
the US Government to foster the field of autonomous robotics. Thrun
has published 11 books, over 300 technical papers, and has won
numerous awards, including most recently the Science Prize of the City
of Braunschweig, Germany. Thrun is an elected member of the National
Academy of Engineering (USA) and of the Leopoldina in Germany.</p>

<h3>Learning-Based Methods for Multimedia<br />
Wednesday Morning, June 25</h3>

<p class="name">Tsuhan Chen</p>

<p>Traditionally, multimedia content retrieval has been mostly based on
low-level processing techniques.  In the past decade, however, it has grown to
become an area where a variety of learning-based tools are used to solve
high-level semantic problems.  These tools conventionally were studied
exclusively in the machine learning community.  In this talk, we will use one
application to illustrate this trend in multimedia content retrieval: object
discovery, i.e., extracting the "object of interest" from a set of images or
videos in a completely unsupervised manner.  Based on feature extraction and
statistical modeling, our approach to object discovery applies to both still
images and motion video.  For video, the spatial-temporal framework
incorporates both appearance modeling and motion modeling, so that motion
ambiguities can be resolved by appearance, and appearance ambiguities can be
resolved by motion.  In addition, based on machine learning methods, we will
show how to extract hierarchical relationships among objects from image/video
data without any manual labeling.</p>

<p><strong>Tsuhan Chen</strong> has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, since
October 1997, where he is currently Professor and Associate Department Head.
From August 1993 to October 1997, he worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories,
Holmdel, New Jersey.  He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical
engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena,
California, in 1990 and 1993, respectively.  He received the B.S. degree in
electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University in 1987.</p>

<p>Tsuhan served as the Editor-in-Chief for IEEE Transactions on Multimedia in
2002-2004.  He also served in the Editorial Board of IEEE Signal Processing
Magazine and as Associate Editor for IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems for
Video Technology, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, IEEE Trans. on Signal
Processing, and IEEE Trans. on Multimedia.  He co-edited a book titled
Multimedia Systems, Standards, and Networks.</p>
 
<p>Tsuhan received the Charles Wilts Prize at the California Institute of
Technology in 1993.  He was a recipient of the National Science Foundation
CAREER Award, from 2000 to 2003.  He received the Benjamin Richard Teare
Teaching Award at the Carnegie Mellon University in 2006.  He is elected to
the Board of Governors, IEEE Signal Processing Society, 2007-2009.  He is a
member of the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society.  He is Fellow of IEEE,
and a Distinguished Lecturer of the Signal Processing Society.</p>

<h3>Social-Mobile Networks<br />
Thursday Morning, June 26</h3>

<p class="name">Frank H.P. Fitzek</p>

<p>Social networking is one of the hot topics in the Internet community. 
People are subscribed to Facebook, myspace and others to communicate or 
to get in contact with other people. Being connected to those platforms 
using mobile phones is already possible now. But this talk should 
highlight social-mobile networks, which are social networks with a much 
shorter life span created for that special moment, whereas the known 
social networks are focused on long term relationship.</p>

<p>Social-mobile networks are formed to get a quick understanding of the 
environment and the people in my proximity. To create that kind of 
knowledge mobile devices will use the short range technologies such as 
WLAN or Bluetooth instead of cellular technologies. The later one may be 
used to establish a long term relationship later on, but the short range 
technology is the key to create contextual information about my 
proximity. Social-mobile networks will come along with new business 
models and service ideas, both introduced in the talk.</p>

<p><strong>Frank H. P. Fitzek</strong> is an Associate Professor in the Department of 
Communication Technology, University of Aalborg, Denmark heading the 
Future Vision and Mobile Device group. He received his diploma 
(Dipl.-Ing.) degree in electrical engineering from the University of 
Technology - Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) - 
Aachen, Germany, in 1997 and his Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) in Electrical 
Engineering from the Technical University Berlin, Germany in 2002 for 
quality of service support in wireless CDMA networks. As a visiting 
student at the Arizona State University he conducted research in the 
field of video services over wireless networks. He co-founded the 
start-up company acticom GmbH in Berlin in 1999. In 2002 he was Adjunct 
Professor at the University of Ferrara, Italy giving lectures on 
wireless communications and conducting research on multi-hop networks. 
In 2005 he won the YRP award for the work on MIMO MDC and received the 
Young Elite Researcher Award of Denmark. Due to his outstanding skills 
and devotion he was selected to receive the Nokia Champion award in 2007 
and 2008. His current research interests are in the areas of wireless 
and mobile communication networks, mobile phone programming, cross layer 
as well as energy efficient protocol design and cooperative networking.</p>
