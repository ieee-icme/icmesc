<h1>Special Sessions</h1>

<p>The following special sessions will be held at ICME 2008.</p>

<h4>Multimedia Signal Processing on Graphics Processors with Hundreds of Cores</h4>


<h4>Personalized Media Processing for Attention Service Applications</h4>


<h4>Distributed Video Coding</h4>


<h4>3D Face Analysis and Recognition</h4>


<h4>Multidimensional Medical Image Processing</h4>


<h4>Reconfigurable Video Coding and Processing via Algorithm/Architecture Co-Exploration for New Emerging Digital Environments</h4>



<!--
<p>At ICME08 two forms of special sessions are being considered to supplement the regular
program: Oral and Panel.</p>

<p>The Oral sessions are expected to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art in a given area and highlight important research directions in a field of
special interest to ICME, while the Panel sessions are expected to gather members of
academia and industry to present their views on a particular topic and participate in an
interactive Q&amp;A with the audience.</p>

<h4>Oral Session Requirements</h4>

<p>Oral sessions should be comprised of 5 invited papers. It is encouraged that the session
begins with an overview paper on the topic being addressed and remaining papers follow
up with technical contributions on the topic.</p>

<p>The following information should be included in the proposal:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Title of the proposed Oral session</li>
   <li>Names/affiliation of organisers (including brief bio and contact info)</li>
   <li>Session abstract (state the significance of the topic and the rationale for the proposed session including the tentative title and an abstract, with no more than 300 words of each paper)</li>
   <li>List of invited presenters</li>
 </ul>

<p>Proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic and relevance to ICME,
as well as the qualifications of the organisers and quality of papers in the proposed
session. Please note that all papers in the proposed session will be reviewed to ensure that
the contributions are of the highest quality. Also, Oral session papers are due the same
day as regular paper submissions. In the event that a special session is not accepted in its
entirety, papers from the proposed session will be considered as part of the regular
technical program.</p>

<p>The deadline for Oral Session proposal is <strong>November 26, 2007</strong>.</p>

<h4>Panel Session Requirements</h4>

<p>Panel sessions should be organised around a topic of current interest that would be well
suited for an open and interactive discussion. Panel sessions should include 3 panelists as
well as a moderator that is capable of stimulating discussion between the panelists and
the audience. It is important that the session organiser contact potential panelists prior to
submission of the proposal to ensure their commitment to attend the conference and
participate in the panel.</p>

<p>The following information should be included in the proposal:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Title of the proposed Panel session</li>
   <li>Names/affiliation of the moderator (including brief bio and contact info)</li>
   <li>Rationale for the proposed session and key points for discussion</li>
   <li>List of panelists (including brief bios)</li>
 </ul>

<p>Proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic and relevance to ICME,
the suitability and perceived interest of the proposed session as a Panel at ICME, as well
as the qualifications of the moderator and panelists in the proposed session. For accepted
sessions, panel members will make a brief presentation on the select topic and will be
expected to answer questions from the audience. The moderator should coordinate Q&#038;A
and may provide some opening and closing remarks.</p>

<p>The deadline for Panel Session proposal is <strong>November 26, 2007</strong>.</p>
