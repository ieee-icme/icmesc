<p><b>PRESENTATION TIME: </b>Presentation time is critical; each paper is 
allocated 20 minutes for oral sessions. We recommend that presentation of 
your slides should take about 17-18 minutes, leaving 2-3 minutes for 
introduction, summary, and questions from the audience. To achieve appropriate 
timing, organize your slides or viewgraphs around the points you intend to make, 
using no more than one slide per minute. A reasonable strategy is to allocate 
about 2 minutes per slide when there are equations or important key points to 
make, and one minute per slide when the content is less complex. Slides attract 
and hold attention, and reinforce what you say - provided you keep them simple 
and easy to read. Plan on covering at most 6 points per slide, covered by 6 to 
12 spoken sentences and no more than about two spoken minutes.</p>
<p><b>ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS:</b> Make sure each of your key points is easy to 
explain with aid of the material on your slides. Do not read directly from the 
slide during your presentation. You shouldn&#39;t need to prepare a written speech, 
although it is often a good idea to prepare the opening and closing sentences in 
advance. It is very important that you rehearse your presentation in front of an 
audience before you give your presentation at ICME. Surrogate presenters must be 
sufficiently familiar with the material being presented to answer detailed 
questions from the audience. In addition, the surrogate presenter must contact 
the Session Chair in advance of the presenter&#39;s session.</p>
<p><b>EQUIPMENT PROVIDED:</b> A computer-driven slideshow for use with a data 
projector is recommended for your talk at ICME. All presentation rooms will be 
equipped with a computer, a data projector, a microphone (for large rooms), 
speakers, and a pointing device. An overhead projector will be provided upon 
request.</p>
<p>Each presenter is expected to preload the presentation in the laptop computer 
at the beginning of the respective session.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poster sessions are a good medium for authors to present papers and meet with 
interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions. In addition, attendees 
find the poster sessions a good way to sample many papers in parallel sessions. 
Thus it is important that you display your message clearly and noticeably to 
attract people who might have an interest in your paper.</p>
<p><br>
<b>ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS: </b>Your poster should cover the key points of your 
work. It need not, and should not, attempt to include all the details; you can 
describe them in person to people who are interested. The ideal poster is 
designed to attract attention, provide a brief overview of your work, and 
initiate discussion. Carefully and completely prepare your poster well in 
advance of the conference. Try tacking up the poster before you leave for the 
conference to see what it will look like and to make sure that you have all of 
the necessary pieces.</p>
<p><br>
<b>DIMENSIONS:</b> For your poster, a board will be provided which measures<b> 
844mm wide by 1162mm tall (portrait orientation).</b></p>
<p><br>
<b>FORMATTING: </b>The title of your poster should appear at the top in CAPITAL 
letters about 25mm high. Below the title put the author(s)&#39; name(s) and 
affiliation(s). The flow of your poster should be from the top left to the 
bottom right. Use arrows to lead your viewer through the poster. Use color for 
highlighting and making your poster more attractive. Use pictures, diagrams, 
cartoons, figures, etc., rather than text wherever possible. The smallest text 
on your poster should be at least 9mm high, and the important points should be 
in a larger size. Use a sans-serif font (such as &quot;cmss&quot; in the Computer Modern 
family or the &quot;Helvetica&quot; PostScript font) to make the print easier to read from 
a distance.</p>
<p>Make your poster as self-explanatory as possible. This will save your efforts 
for technical discussions. There will not be any summaries given at the 
beginning of the poster sessions at ICME 2007, so authors need not prepare any 
overhead slides for their poster presentations. You may bring additional 
battery-operated audio or visual aids to enhance your presentation.</p>
<p>Prepare a short presentation of about 5 or 10 minutes that you can 
periodically give to those assembled around your poster throughout the poster 
session. If possible, more than one author should attend the session to aid in 
presentations and discussions, and to provide the presenters with the chance to 
rest or briefly view other posters.<br>
