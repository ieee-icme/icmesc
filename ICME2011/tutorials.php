<h2><a name="tutho"></a>Technical Challenges of 3D Video Processing</h2>
<p><strong>Date/Time</strong>: July 11, Â morning 9:00 - 12:30</p>
<p><strong>Room</strong>: <a href="program.php#jhc">JHC.02</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In recent years, various three-dimensional video services have become available and the demand for three-dimensional video processing is growing rapidly. Since 3DTV is considered as the next generation  broadcasting service that can deliver realistic and immersive experiences by supporting user-friendly interactions, a number of advanced three-dimensional video technologies have been studied. In this tutorial lecture, after reviewing the current status of 3DTV research activities, we are going to cover several challenging issues of 3D video processing, such as camera calibration, image rectification, illumination  compensation and color correction. In this tutorial lecture, we are also going to discuss the MPEG activities for 3D video coding, including depth map estimation, prediction structure for multi-view video coding, multi-view video-plus-depth coding, and intermediate view synthesis at virtual viewpoints.</p>

<h2><a name="tutzz"></a>Audio, Video, and Their Joint Processing with Applications to Teleconferencing</h2>
<p><strong>Date/Time</strong>: July 11, afternoon 13:30 - 18:00</p>
<p><strong>Room</strong>: <a href="program.php#jhc">JHC.02</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Audio/video processing is the building block for many multimedia systems and applications. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an overview of some recent advances in audio, video and their joint processing, in particular for teleconferencing applications. Key topics covered by this tutorial include sound source localization from compact microphone arrays, 3D spatial sound and multi-channel echo cancellation, various real-time video processing techniques for enhancing conferencing experiences, and a few explorations on the adoption of the soon-to-be-commodity depth sensors in conferencing applications. We hope the techniques presented in this tutorial can sharpen the tools multimedia researchers use, and help build better multimedia systems (not limited to conferencing) in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="tutfe"></a>Quality of Experience (QoE) in Multimedia Communications</h2>
<p><strong>Date/Time</strong>: July 15, morning 9:00 - 12:30</p>
<p><strong>Room</strong>: <a href="program.php#jhc">JHC.02</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p align="justify">High quality and mobility are key elements of today's media experience. People expect the same level of quality on their portable devices as on their desktop computer or home entertainment system. Under these stringent requirements, the value of media services is no longer confined to the face value of the end products delivered to the customers, but in the level of satisfaction and experiences they provide. Hence, the ultimate measure of the value of media services is how the end user experiences them. Thus the customer's Quality of Experience (QoE) must become the ultimate baseline for delivering new media products. The term Quality of Experience can be considered relatively new to multimedia understanding. Different flavours of QoE definitions are stated throughout the literature. Generally QoE could be defined as &quot;the overall acceptability of an application or service, as perceived subjectively by the end-user&quot;. The term QoE  has been coined to differentiate between user perceived quality and technical quality measures relating to data transport, commonly denoted Quality of Service (QoS).</p>

<p align="justify">Today the ultimate challenge faced by the service providers is to deliver the maximum Quality of Experience to end-users with an optimal encoding scheme under transmission constrains such as bandwidth and other limitations. To achieve this, the video services need to be continuously monitored to ensure that users experience them as being of adequate quality. These quality monitoring procedures must necessarily be automated, since it would be obviously impracticable to have test persons continuously evaluating an entire delivery chain from content provider to the end-user. Thus requirement of quantifiable quality measurements are understandable. In this tutorial we will discuss the motivations behind the QoE and its importance for future multimedia services, existing objective based metrics, current situation with the QoE research, the hypothetical models and limitations, Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Business (QoB), their relationship to the application provider/content provider and the user and maximise the quality and revenue, practical solutions and some of the potential application domains.</p>

<h2><a name="tutmm"></a>Packet Core Network Evolution in regard to Future Internet Research</h2>
<p>Date/Time: July 15, afternoon 13:30 - 18:00</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p align="justify">This half day workshop will provide an overview of Next Generation Mobile Network as defined by the NGMN Alliance (www.ngmn.org) and the related 3GPP specifications related to the 3GPP Evolved Packet System EPS) - also known as Service Architecture Evolution (SAE). In this regard we will look at envisaged Next Generation Mobile Network applications, LTSI requirements, and most importantly the 3GPP standards related to the Long term Evolution (LTE) and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). In addition, the tutorial will also address the potential EPS application domains, namely the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as well as potential internet service architectures. The tutorial terminates with an introduction to the OpenEPC (www.openepc.net) software toolkit from Fraunhofer FOKUS and Technical University Berlin enabling rapid Next Generation Mobile Network prototyping for academic and industry research.</p>
