                                It takes nature and evolution more than five hundred million years to develop a powerful visual system in humans. The journey for AI and computer vision is about fifty years. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the key ideas and the cutting edge advances in the quest for visual intelligences in computers. I will particularly focus on the latest work developed in my lab for both image and video understanding, powered by big data and the deep learning (a.k.a. neural network) architecture.

                        <p><strong><span style="line-height: 2;" class="auto-style2">Abstract:</span></strong><br />In an era where people share more about themselves than ever before, can
technology be used to create deeper empathy and understanding? This
talk describes Empathic Computing, systems that help people better
understand each other, and how to design for understanding. There have
been several decades of research on Affective Computing systems that
recognise a users emotion, but until recently there has been little
research on how to use technology to share emotions between people.
Technology such as wearable computing, smart sensors, and Augmented and
Virtual Reality, can be combined together to enable people to capture
their surroundings and feelings and share them with others. In order to
do this there are interesting problems to be solved in recognising
emotion, repenting emotion, and measuring the impact of emotion, among
other topics. Examples of how to do this will be shared from leading
research groups, including the Empathic Computing Laboratory at the
University of South Australia, and directions described for future
work. The 1980's were about Multi-media, the 2000's Social Media and
2020's could be the decade of Empathic Media.</p>

Mark Billinghurst is Professor of Human Computer Interaction at the
University of South Australia in Adelaide, Australia. He earned a PhD
in 2002 from the University of Washington and researches innovative
computer interfaces that explore how virtual and real worlds can be
merged, publishing over 300 papers in topics such as wearable
computing, Augmented Reality and mobile interfaces. Prior to joining
the University of South Australia he was Director of the HIT Lab NZ at
the University of Canterbury and he has previously worked at British
Telecom, Nokia, Google and the MIT Media Laboratory. His MagicBook
project, was winner of the 2001 Discover award for best entertainment
application, and he received the 2013 IEEE VR Technical Achievement
Award for contributions to research and commercialization in Augmented
Reality. In 2013 he was selected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of
New Zealand.</p>

                        <p><strong><span style="line-height: 2;" class="auto-style2">Abstract:</span></strong><br />
The automotive field is in the midst of a transformation. Cheap sensors and powerful
hardware, coupled with machine learning algorithms and big data rapidly advance
the capabilities of modern vehicles. In the traditional vehicle sector, where
the driver is under control, the automation level is gradually increased;
witness the ever more sophisticated autopilots for the highway introduced in
premium cars nowadays (e.g. Mercedes-Benz E-Class 2016 Drive Pilot). At the
same time, a new vehicle sector is emerging:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that of self-driving vehicles, where the human driver is no longer
necessary and where control is exerted remotely by an operator, as part of a
mobility service. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">What can be
automated in a vehicle?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why does vehicle
automation make sense? How does the technology work? What are the remaining
hurdles? When will automated vehicles come about? This talk will provide some
answers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dariu M. Gavrila received the MSc degree in computer science from the
Vrije University in Amsterdam in 1990. He received the PhD degree in
computer science from the University of Maryland at College Park, USA,
in 1996. Since 1997, he has been with Daimler R&amp;D in Ulm, Germany,
where he is currently a Distinguished Scientist. In 2003, he was also
appointed professor in the Faculty of Science at the University of
Amsterdam, chairing the area of Intelligent Perception Systems (part
time). Over the past 15 years, Prof. D. M. Gavrila has worked on
perception systems for detecting humans and their activity, with
application to intelligent vehicles, smart surveillance and social
robotics. He led the multi-year pedestrian detection research effort at
Daimler which was incorporated in the Mercedes-Benz S-, E-, and C-Class
models (2013-2014). Prof. D. M. Gavrila published 50+ papers in
top-tier conferences and journals, and is frequently cited in his
domain (Google Scholar: about 10.000 times). He served as Area Chair at
previous IV, ICCV, AVSS, and DAGM conferences; he is currently Program
Co-Chair for the upcoming IEEE Intelligent Vehicles (IV) 2016
conference in Götheborg, Sweden. He delivered keynotes at previous IV,
ICVS, AVSS, CAIP and ÖAGM conferences. For the societal impact of his
research, Prof. D. M. Gavrila received the I/O 2007 Award from the
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the IEEE
Intelligent Transportation Systems Application Award 2014 (the latter
