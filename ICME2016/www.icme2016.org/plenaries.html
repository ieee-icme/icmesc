                        <p><strong><span style ="line-height:2.0;" class="auto-style2">Abstract:</span></strong><br />In an era where people share more about themselves than ever before, can technology be used to create deeper empathy and understanding? This talk describes Empathic Computing, systems that help people better understand each other, and how to design for understanding. There have been several decades of research on Affective Computing systems that recognise a users emotion, but until recently there has been little research on how to use technology to share emotions between people. Technology such as wearable computing, smart sensors, and Augmented and Virtual Reality, can be combined together to enable people to capture their surroundings and feelings and share them with others. In order to do this there are interesting problems to be solved in recognising emotion, repenting emotion, and measuring the impact of emotion, among other topics. Examples of how to do this will be shared from leading research groups, including the Empathic Computing Laboratory at the University of South Australia, and directions described for future work. The 1980's were about Multi-media, the 2000's Social Media and 2020's could be the decade of Empathic Media.</p>
