                                                <p>Augmented
and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) are emerging technologies that both blur
the boundary between the physical and digital worlds; AR can seamlessly
blend the physical and digital content, enhancing the real world
experience, while VR completely immerses the user in digital content,
enhancing the virtual experience. Both AR and VR involve multiple media
from audio to haptics, with the core technical disciplines of the
Multimedia research community all being highly applicable. It is
commonly believed that the widespread commercialization of AR and VR
could well be as impactful to the future of the human experience as the
introduction of radio and television in the past.</p>                                                
                                                <p>After
nearly 50 years of research and development, 2016 promises to be a
breakout year for AR and VR. Many of the advances are taking place in
Seattle, US, in development at companies like Google, Microsoft,
Facebook, and Valve, a thriving start-up community, and research labs
at the University of Washington and other academic institutions.</p>
                                                <p>With
this panel, we aim to give an overview of the future of AR and VR. We
have collected together some of the key players who will discuss 1) the
importance of AR and VR as new media of high relevance to the
Multimedia community, 2) the timeliness of 2016 as a breakout year for
AR/VR technologies, and 3) what can be expected over the next 5 to 10
years of development in the fields.</p>

his B.A. in computer science and mathematics at the University of
California, Berkeley in 1991 and his Ph.D. in computer sciences at the
University of Wisconsin in 1997. Following his doctoral work, he spent
one year visiting the Vision Technology Group at Microsoft Research and
the subsequent two years as an Assistant Professor in the Robotics
Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. He joined the faculty at the
University of Washington in July 2000. He co-authored papers that have
