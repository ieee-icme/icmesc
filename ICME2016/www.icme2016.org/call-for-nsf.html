<div class="auto-style1">
    <div class="auto-style1"> ICME2016 is
organizing a student program as part of the main conference program, to
provide an effective and inexpensive way of encouraging junior
researchers in multimedia research. The specific goals of the student
program are the following:</div>
<ul>
<li class="auto-style1">To provide a setting for face-to-face
interaction and feedback on student participants’ current research and
constructive guidance on their future research directions;</li>
<li class="auto-style1">To promote networking among Ph.D. students working in the related area;</li>
<li class="auto-style1">To develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research;</li>
<li class="auto-style1">To support a new generation of researchers with
information and advice on academic, research, industrial, and
non-traditional career paths; and</li> 
<li class="auto-style1">To contribute to the conference goals through interactions with other researchers and participations in conference events.</li>
</ul>
    <div class="auto-style1">
The NSF travel support will encourage students enrolled in Ph.D.
programs in the U.S. to attend the conference and participate in the
student program, helping them get timely feedback from world-class
experts in the field.
<br /><br />

        </strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;" class="auto-style2">
        <br />
ICME2016 is pleased to announce that NSF will provide a total of
$16,000 to support the travel and participation of 10 students enrolled
in Ph.D. programs in the U.S. to attend ICME2016. Each student will
receive up to $1,500 travel award, which includes partial flat airfare,
three nights of hotel plus some local travel and expenses, and
conference registration. Original receipts will be required.
<br /><br />

    <strong>Selection Process and Rules</strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;" class="auto-style2"><br />
    </span></div>
        <br />
        <strong>Eligibility</strong>:
Students enrolled in Ph.D. programs in the U.S. are eligible. In the
Call for Participation (provide specific link), we have not explicitly
excluded the possibility of students who are not presenting papers at
ICME2016 to be included in the student event, but the expectation is
that all participants will also have papers at ICME 2016. <br /><br />
        <strong>Application</strong>: Application deadline for the NSF Travel Support is<span style="color: red;"> May 13, 2016</span>.  Please submit the following documents via CMT (<a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ICMEW2016" target="_blank">https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ICMEW2016</a>) in the “Student Program Track” as a single PDF file:
    <ul>
<li class="auto-style1">An abstract of the student’s thesis (maximum 1 page);</li> 
<li class="auto-style1">CV (maximum 2 pages), which should include the student’s contact details; and</li> 
<li class="auto-style1">A support/recommendation letter from the student’s Advisor confirming the student status.</li>  
        </ul>        
            <strong>Selection</strong>:
Student applications will be evaluated by the Student Program Co-Chairs
to receive the travel support based on the expected benefit to the
student, the quality of the student’s work, the advisor’s supporting
letter, publication record and other accomplishments, the progress or
status of the student’s dissertation work, and the diversity in student
participants (e.g., students from different regions, underrepresented
groups, smaller schools or schools with less established multimedia
research). Students with a first-authored paper accepted at the main
conference will have the priority. <br /><br />
        <strong>Rules</strong>: The selected 10
U.S.-based PhD students would be required to present in the 3MT
competition. After the 3MT Competition, they would attend the
Student-Industry Luncheon and discuss their work with their mentors.
Mentors will provide written feedback, and both the mentors and the
students will fill out a short survey. <br /><br />
Based on the NSF policy, if a student uses any part of $1,500 for
airfare, the student will need to use U.S. carriers (i.e., if the
flight is shared among airlines, they will need to book the flight
through the U.S. airline). Please keep all the receipts.
<br /><br />
(<strong>Note</strong>: All applicants selected for the <strong>NSF Travel Support </strong>will
automatically be registered for the Three Minute Thesis (3MT)
competition and the luncheon as well, so there is no need to submit
separate applications.)
Application deadline for the NSF Travel Support is extended to <strong style="color: red;">May&nbsp;13, 2016</strong>.

If you have any questions, please e-mail Student Program Co-Chairs Z. Jane Wang <a href="mailto:%28zjanew@ece.ubc.ca">(zjanew@ece.ubc.ca</a>) and Ivan V. Bajić <a href="mailto:%28ibajic@ensc.sfu.ca">(ibajic@ensc.sfu.ca</a>).
