            <br/>
            <p class="indent">Recently, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are being deployed for monitoring and managing medical conditions as well as human performance in sports. These BSNs include various sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, EMG (Electro myograms), EKG (Electro-cardiograms), and other sensors depending on the needs of the medical conditions. Data from these sensors are typically Time Series data and the data from multiple sensors form multiple, multidimensional time series data. Analyzing data from such multiple medical sensors pose several challenges: different sensors have different characteristics, different people generate different patterns through these sensors, and even for the same person the data can vary widely depending on time and environment.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">This tutorial describes the technologies that go behind BSNs both in terms of the hardware infrastructure as well as the basic software. First, we outline the BSN hardware features and the related requirements. We then discuss the energy and communication choices for BSNs. Next, we discuss approaches for classification, data mining, visualization, and securing these data. We also show several demonstrations of body sensor networks as well as the software that aid in analyzing the data.</p>

            <h3><a name=full_2>Tutorial 2: Sound Capture and Processing for Multimedia Systems (Presenters: I. Tashev)</a></h3> 
            <br/>
            <p class="indent">The sound is integral part of the multimedia systems. It accompanies video streaming and TV broadcasting, in certain cases the sound itself is the major information stream (radio broadcasting, podcasting).  Analyzing the sound content varies from simple event detection, to speech recognition and sophisticated language analysis, to joint processing of the sound and the video channels. In many cases the sound capturing is not done properly, which results in poor sound quality, affecting the results from sound analysis. 
            <p class="indent">The tutorial will present techniques and algorithms for capturing sound and its enhancement for the needs or multimedia systems. It will start with basics of the audio processing, sound capturing and suppression and will end with state of the art noise suppression and reduction algorithms for single and multiple channels. The tutorial will be illustrated with charts and tables containing results from processing real audio signals. Several demos will illustrate the tutorial content. Besides providing of good sound quality some of the presented techniques are important cues for multimodal processing, such as sound source localization.</p>
            <p class="indent">The presenter, Dr. Ivan Tashev, has Diploma Engineer degree in Electronics and PhD in Computer Science from Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria, 1984 and 1989 respectively. He was assistant professor for nine years in the Department of Electronics of the same university. Dr. Tashev joined Microsoft in 1998, currently he is member of Speech Technology Group in Microsoft Research. He created various algorithms for sound capture, noise suppression and microphone array processing, including the integrated in Windows Vista microphone array support, sound capture and processing for headsets and mobile devices. Dr. Tashev has more than 50 published papers and filed for 18 US patents. He is senior member of IEEE, member of Technical Committees of IEEE IWAENC and IEEE WASPAA, reviewer for most of the journals and conferences in signal processing area.

            <p class="indent"><u>Presenterâs biography</u>: Dr. Tashev graduated Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria, with Diploma Engineer degree in Electronics in 1984 and toke his PhD degree in Computer Science in the same university in 1989. He was assistant professor in the Department of Electronics in Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria, for nine years. Co-creator of the course âSignals and data processingâ for the fourth year students in Department of Electronics in the same university. Read the lectures of this course for seven years. Author of a book with same name, published by the Technical University of Sofia. Dr. Tashev joined Microsoft in 1998, currently he is member of Speech Technology Group in Microsoft Research. He created various algorithms for sound capture, noise suppression and microphone array processing. They include the integrated in Windows Vista microphone array support, sound capture and processing for headsets and mobile devices. Recently he is heavily involved in a project called Commute UX â in-car speech enabled dialog system and faces the challenges of sound capturing in the car and less distractive, speech enabled user interfaces. Some of the technologies from this project eventually will find their way to Microsoft Automotive platform â the base of FIAT Blue&Me and Ford SYNC. Dr. Tashev has more than 50 published papers and filed 18 US patents. Dr. Tashev is senior member of IEEE, member of Signal Processing society.

            <h3><a name=half_6>Tutorial 6: Near-Duplicate Image/Video Detection: From Indexing to Mining (Presenters: C- W. Ngo)</a></h3>
            <br/>
            <p class="indent">As bandwidth accessible to average users is increasing, image and video have become the fastest growing data type in Internet. Especially with the popularity of social media, there has been exponential growth in images/videos available on the Web. Among these huge volumes of images/videos, there exist large numbers of near-duplicates and copies. Near-duplicates (ND) carry both blessing and redundant signals. For example, ND provides rich visual clue for indexing and summarizing broadcast videos from different channels. On the other hand, the excessive amount of ND makes browsing web videos streamed over Internet an extremely time-consuming task. ND detection has thus appeared as a timely problem, being often regarded as a powerful tool for various emerging multimedia applications. The ND detection problem is considered challenging because a variety of capturing, digitalization and editing conditions can lead to groups of supposingly similar images or video clips, but appear differently due to a serial of geometry and photometric transformations.</p>

            <p class="indent">This tutorial is to present the audience a broad overview of ND detection, including the fundamental concept, algorithm, challenge and opportunity of this problem. The first part of tutorial will discuss the most typical algorithms of ND detection for feature extraction, indexing, matching and filtering. Attention will be paid for the use of local interest point (or keypoint) for this problem. Specifically, different ways of utilizing keypoints for detection: as a dictionary, a visual language, a sparse set of points with temporal-spatial regularity, will be described. The second part of the tutorial will present two applications of ND detection for multimedia and web video mining. In the first application, novel algorithms, which treat near-duplicates as must-link constraints, for mining video cluster and topic structure will be described. In the second application, a real-time solution, by fully leveraging the content and context information available on Web, for web-scale mining of near-duplicate Internet videos will be presented.</p>
