        <br>
        <b></b>-- As of May 6, WHO had reported that 309 persons with  laboratory-confirmed disease had been identified in 21 countries other  than Mexico and the United States. Of 178 patients for whom travel history was available, 145 (82%) reported recent travel to Mexico, and four (2%) reported travel to the United States. Among those who had not traveled to Mexico, 17 (52%) reported contact with a returning traveler from Mexico.  </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">-- The Department of State of the US alerts U.S. citizens of the health  risks of travel to Mexico, recommending that American citizens avoid all  nonessential travel to Mexico. This Travel Alert expires on July 27, 2009. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">-- The official WHO report on May 6 did not mention where did these people go in Mexico. And, Mexican official confirmed case in Cancun is 2, as of May 9. However, in many related news in the last 2 weeks, if an exact location was mentioned in local newspapers, the travel destination was Cancun. That includes, the initial cases in Vancouver, Scotland,  Sacramento, New York, England, Westchester, Ohio, etc...  </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">-- The swine-flu epidemic in Mexico has led to the temporary closure of 16 hotels and an 85 percent drop in tourist arrivals in Cancun, the Riviera Maya and Cozumel, the country&rsquo;s main tourist destinations, Mexico  officials said on May 9.  </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">-- We conducted a poll on May 4th and 5th to our 400 ICME 2009  registrants. 294 out of 400 responded to the poll. Among the respondents,  58% said they were facing travel ban to Mexico by their country, company,  or both. 56% said they will not or unlikely go to Cancun in June. Because  of personal health, many people showed their strong concern on traveling  to Cancun in the foreseeable future. Even if the conference is shifted to  September in Cancun, (and expect the travel ban will be removed), at least 30% of people will not attend. Based on IEEE's experience and the survey, moving dates results in many conflicts. It is not an option. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">To protect the health of our participants, we have to move ICME 2009 to  another location. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">-- Swine Flu in New York City (as of May 7) tests confirmed the infection  in patients with fever and cough: Total Cases to Date: 157 (4 more probable cases are under testing) Cases Linked to Known Clusters:<br></font><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">&gt;&gt; Mexico: 2 <br>&gt;&gt; St. Francis Preparatory: 135 <br>&gt;&gt; PS 177: 7<br> No Links to Known Clusters: 8 <br>Under investigation: 5 </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="courier,gothic,helvetica">The swine flu cases in NYC were first reported by 20 students in St.  Francis Preparatory High School who traveled to Cancun and came back NY on April 19. Elementary School PS 177 infections started from siblings of the St. Francis Preparatory students. So far, there is no apparent unknown outbreak in  NYC. <br>
