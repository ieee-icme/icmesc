<h1>Call for Poster Papers</h1>
<h2>Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing and Novel Parallel Computing</h2>
<h3>at 2009 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo</h3>
<h3>July 2, 2009 (third day of the ICME conference), Cancun, Mexico</h3>
</center>

The goal of this workshop is to give the attendees (1) an overview and trend of the emerging MMSP applications and (2) a deep-dive into the interaction between multimedia application and novel parallel architecture.  
<p>
In particular, the increasing architectural complexity and application sophistication make it essential to have an inter-disciplinary research between algorithms and hardware designs. The workshop is to bridge the gap between algorithms and architecture designs for the development of future computer and multimedia systems. In particular, multi-core processors are now prevalent everywhere from desktops and graphics processors to laptops and embedded systems. Technology predictions indicate that this trend will continue and that there will be increasing numbers of cores (homogenous or heterogeneous) in future systems. It is clear that multimedia systems of tomorrow will be (and must be) implemented on platforms with multiple cores. While the challenges of designing multi-core systems in hardware are many, writing efficient parallel applications that utilize the computing capability of many processing cores may reveal to be even more challenging. Existing serial algorithms will need to be redesigned -- the best sequential algorithm is not necessarily the best parallel algorithm. Signal processing algorithm designers must understand the nuances of a multi-core computing engine. Only then can the tremendous computing power that such platforms provide be harnessed efficiently.
<p>
We are organizing a poster session in the workshop. We would like to attract both tutorial-like and non-tutorial, research-oriented poster papers on (1) novel multimedia applications that can be enabled by platform with multiple cores, and (2) design examples of multimedia signal processing on platforms with multiple cores that demonstrate the techniques or algorithm changes for efficient implementations. 

<h3>Submission Procedure:</h3>
Prospective authors should submit 2-page white papers to the workshop chairs according to the following timetable. The white paper should summarize the key takeaway messages (&quot;What can the attendee learn from the poster?&quot;), the motivation (&quot;Why should a attendee care the poster?&quot;), the significance of the topic (&quot;Why is this topic important?&quot;), a brief history (&quot;What are the related work and authors' prior publications in this topic?&quot;), and the outline of the content (&quot;What do you plan to explain the poster?&quot;). The authors should properly answer all the questions above so that the white paper can be reviewed efficiently. After answering the above questions, the authors can selectively describe some details within the rest of page limit. The white paper should be no more than 2 pages in the IEEE single-space double-column format.
<p>
Please note that a special issue on &quot;Signal Processing on Platforms with Multiple Cores&quot; that focuses on design and applications is planned for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine (<a href="http://apollo.ee.columbia.edu/spm/?i=cfp/Mar10">http://apollo.ee.columbia.edu/spm/?i=cfp/Mar10</a>).  Prospective authors are encouraged to submit the tutorial-like whitepapers to both the workshop and the Magazine.
