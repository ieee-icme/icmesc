<h1>Presentation Guidelines</h1>
<p align="justify">ICME 2013 follows the ICME NO SHOW policy. Accepted work without presentation (including oral, poster and demo) will not be included in IEEE Xplore publication.</p>

<h2>Oral Presentation Guidelines</h2>
<p align="justify">Each full paper in an oral session is allocated 20 minutes (short paper has 10 minutes each). This includes time for questions from the audience.</p>

<p align="justify">Please bring your own laptop for presentation. Data projector will be provided in each conference room. It is recommended to test the presentation materials, e.g. video and audio, in advance of the session to ensure compatibility. Prepare the material handy on a jump-drive in case your laptop is not compatible and it needs to be copied onto another laptop for presentation. Each room will have a student volunteer that can help to provide technical support.</p>
 
<p align="justify">Presenters are requested to be present in the room at least 10 minutes before the start of their session and introduce themselves to the session chair. <strong>Best Paper and Best Student Paper</strong> will be awarded based on the technical merit, presentation content and presenter's performance.</p>

<h2><a name="guideposter"></a>Poster Presentation Guidelines</h2>
<p align="justify">Authors need to stand by their posters during these sessions which enable presenters to discuss research and development with the audience and to gain feedback as well as to establish potential contacts.</p>

<p align="justify">Posters should be in 36 inches x 48 inches (maximum) landscape format. In each poster session, posters are assigned unique poster ID from 1 to 80, which should match the poster locations. Authors should put up their posters in the morning of their session which starts after lunch from 13:00 to 14:00. Posters should be dismounted by the end of the day. Pins/adhesive will be provided to mount the posters. The presenter is expected to be stationed by his/her poster and answer questions from the audience. <strong>Best Poster Presentation</strong> will be awarded based on the poster content and presenter's performance.</p>

<h2>Demo Associated with Full, Short or Theme Papers</h2>
<p align="justify">Authors applied for demo tables during camera-ready upload should check the accepted papers list. If the application is successful, there is a demo session (D1, D2 or D3) assigned together with the oral or poster session. For poster authors, the demo tables will be at the respective poster locations. For oral authors, the demo tables will be assigned after the highest poster ids. Oral authors with demo tables should bring copies of their paper abstract for distribution or put up a poster to showcase the research work. The presenter should bring his/her own laptop for the demonstration. Power sockets will be available at the demo tables.</p>

<h2>Demo Papers Presentation (Session D4)</h2>

<p align="justify">Presentations of accepted demo papers are scheduled on July 18 from 15:40 to 16:40.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Best Demo</strong> will be awarded (D1-D4) based on the demo content and presenter's performance.</p>

<h2>Best Paper Candidates Overview (Session OV1 and OV2)</h2>

<p align="justify">In addition to the oral presentations, high quality papers recommended by the Technical Program Committee are given 1 minute extra introduction time during Session OV1 or OV2 to showcase the work. A powerpoint slide should be prepared and emailed to the TPC Chairs <a href="mailto:xshua@microsoft.com">xshua@microsoft.com</a> and <a href="mailto:locheng@ualberta.ca">locheng@ualberta.ca</a> by  July 1.
