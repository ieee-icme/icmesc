    <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: The last a few years have been really exciting &ndash; media technology has experienced revolutionary changes that would normally take decades in the past. High definition media becomes ubiquitous thanks to the availability of broadband Internet, high&ndash;speed cellular data service, broad deployment of digital television, and the convergence of mobile and CE devices. In this presentation, using modern computer architecture as an example, I will take a deeper look at the fundamental computational building blocks and its rapid advances that support such transition.</p></td>

      <p align="justify"><strong><a href="http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/bios?n=Hong%20Jiang&f=searchAll">Hong Jiang</a></strong> is an Intel Fellow and the chief media architect and director of the Visual and Parallel Computing Group's Media Architecture Team at Intel Corporation. He leads the media architecture of processor graphics and its derivatives, including the definition of media hardware and software assets and the group's technology roadmap. As chief media architect &ndash; a position he has held since 2002 &ndash; Jiang earned recognition for co-inventing the programmable Intel graphics architecture that has powered all Intel client PCs since 2006.</p>
      <p align="justify">In a previous role as a platform architect at Intel, Jiang contributed to and co-edited key interconnect and video-coding standards. Earlier, as a video architect, he led video decoder and video capture hardware and software definition and implementation for chipset graphics products. Jiang joined Intel in 1996 in the then-newly formed graphics operation in Intel's PCI Component Division.</p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Advanced digital video processing continues to be a technological cornerstone for content production and delivery in media and entertainment. Video technology becomes even more critical in the advent of transmedia storytelling when content is being created across multiple media types and genres, or for interactive end user experiences. The purpose of this talk is to give an overview of the major trends in the media and entertainment industry and to provide an insight into the complex technical challenges of capturing, processing and displaying rich and high quality content. I will review the content creation pipeline and illustrate some novel solutions we designed at Disney Research for video capture beyond stereoscopic3D, stereo conversion, disparity mapping, spatio-temporal video processing, light field reconstruction, framerate conversion, and view interpolation.</p></td>

    <td width="85%"><p><strong>Title</strong>: Just Noticeable Differences &mdash; What Can We Notice in Multimedia Systems?</p>
    <p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Benjamin Wah, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong</p>
    <p><strong>Date/Time</strong>: July 18th 9:00 - 10:00 am</p>
    <p><strong>Room</strong>: Regency1</p>
    <p><strong>Session Chair</strong>: Irene Cheng, University of Alberta, Canada</p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Just-noticeable difference (JND) refers to the smallest detectable difference between a starting and a secondary level of a particular sensory stimulus. It was first pioneered by Ernst Weber, a 19th century experimental psychologist. Weber's Law simply states that the size of JND is a constant proportion of the original stimulus value. Although the concept is known for over one and a half centuries, it has recently received more attention in the multimedia community. With the quality degradations incurred by losses and delays in transferring multimedia signals over the Internet, researchers have found that existing quantitative metrics cannot model perceptual degradations experienced by users. In this presentation, we examine the limitations of current results on JND and the reasons why they are inadequate for improving the perceptual quality of multimedia systems. Features that contribute to the complications include the presence of multiple and possibly dependent stimuli that may be related to perceptual quality in a linear or nonlinear fashion and whose effects may be additive or non-additive. We present new results and illustrate their effects on JND using various applications in online games, video conferencing, video coding, and remote control. The understanding of the properties of JND with multidimensional stimuli will help reduce the number of subjective tests needed in designing better QoE-based control and optimization in multimedia algorithms.</p></td>
