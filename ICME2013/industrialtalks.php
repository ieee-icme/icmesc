    <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: The explosion of multimedia data (image, video,  3D, etc.) from mobile image captures, social sharing, the web, TV shows and  movies, and the availability of large amount of metadata have created  unprecedented opportunities and fundamental challenges to multimedia signal  processing. They are not just big in volume, but also unstructured and  multi-modal.</p>
    <p align="justify">The emergence of Big Data has brought about a  paradigm shift to all fields of computing. Most Big Data systems currently in  use are very restrictive in nature in that it is quite difficult to handle data  types other than text or numbers. Moreover, text and numbers are handled using  pre-defined fields only in the database. It is extremely difficult to  store/retrieve multimedia data. This is attributed to the fact that although we  have seen remarkable advances in computing power, storage capacity and network  speed/reach, the underlying technology to retrieve multimedia data is not only  hard, but often ill-defined.</p>
<p align="justify">The talk provides an overview of  recent developments in multimedia Big Data. Insights we didn&rsquo;t have before with  &ldquo;small data&rdquo; suddenly arise. Problems we didn&rsquo;t see before are becoming  critical. Algorithms that are ill fitted before are now attractive. This  keynote hopes to bring closer researchers in multimedia processing and Big Data  to foster joint discussions between the two fields.</p></td>

    <p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Jin Li, Microsoft Research, USA</p>
    <p><strong>Date/Time</strong>: July 17th 14:00 - 15:00</p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: The   amount of data generated and stored grows at a 60% compound annual growth rate over a span of 15 years (2001-2015), and outpaces the cost decline of the disk drive. In this talk, we will discuss two technologies that makes storage in the cloud and/or in a server cluster efficient and reliable: 1) Primary data deduplication, and 2) Local Reconstruction Coding.</p>
    <p align="justify">Primary data deduplication brings dedup to primary data, which is created, accessed, and changed actively by end-users. Moreover, the solution   shares system resource with other primary workload running on the systems. This enables deduplication on a broad category of platforms where a variety of workloads and services compete for system resources and no   assumptions of dedicated hardware is made. Since release in Windows Server 2012, the primary data deduplication feature has received rave review with significant infrastructure saving.</p>
    <p align="justify">Erasure coding is a mathematical tool that codes the stored data into a small set of redundant parity to protect the data from loss due to   hardware/software failures in the storage cluster. We have designed local reconstruction code (LRC), which is a new family of erasure codes. The major benefits of LRC are that it reduces the bandwidth and I/Os required for repair reads over prior codes, while still allowing a significant reduction in storage overhead. LRC has been adopted in Windows Azure Storage, which provides a low overhead durable storage with consistently low read latencies.</p></td>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: As the ITU standardized Ultra High Definition (UHD) video format, we  enter a new video era when more video source will be captured not only in  higher definition and higher frame rate, but also higher bit depth and richer  color. What does that mean to the video traffic that already consumes a large  percentage of today's data traffic on the networks? Is the newly standardized High  Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard sufficient to handle the additional  bandwidth demand as consumption of UHD video increases? In this talk, we will  investigate the potential issues related to transmission and consumption of UHD  video, and discuss how the HEVC standard and its scalable extensions can be  used to alleviate the problems caused by increased UHD video traffic. Finally,  we conclude this talk with a short discussion video coding technologies beyond  the HEVC standard.</p></td>
