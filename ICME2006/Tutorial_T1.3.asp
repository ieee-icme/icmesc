<h1>T1.3 Digital Inpainting</h1>

<p><strong>Sunday, July 9, 2006 (09:00 - 12:00, Thomson)</strong></p>

<h4>Instructor</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.mine.tku.edu.tw/chinese/teacher/tshih.htm">Professor Timothy K. Shih</a>, <em>Tamkang University, Taiwan</em></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>Digital inpainting is an interesting new research topic in multimedia
computing and image processing since 2000. This tutorial will cover the most
recent contributions in digital image inpainting / image completion, video
inpainting, and 3-D surface completion. In the literature, the first intention
of image inpainting was to remove damages portions of an aged photo, by
completing the area with surrounding or global information. The techniques used
include the analysis and usage of pixel properties in spatial and frequency
domains. Furthermore, image inpainting techniques were used in object removal
(or image completion) in photos. Several strategic algorithms were developed
based on confidence values and priorities of using pixels. The techniques used
in still images were then extended to video inpainting, which need to consider
temporal properties such as motion vectors. With a reasonable combination of
object tracking and image completion, objects in video can be removed and
possibly replaced. On the other hand, aged films contain two types of defects:
spikes and lone vertical lines. These defects need to be precisely detected and
removed to restore the original film. In addition, based on image completion
techniques, incompleteness of scanning results of a 3-D scanner due to improper
location or other reasons of a scanner can be solved. This tutorial will
discuss the above techniques founded in more than 30 top papers. In addition to
an overview, the tutorial will be divided into 4 sections: image inpainting,
video inpainting, 3-D surface inpainting, and a section to discuss inpainting
projects developed by the presenter. Demonstrations will be included. In
addition, the tutorial presenter will distribute a CD ROM to the audience. The
CD ROM will include several interesting computer programs for testing
inpainting results.</p>
