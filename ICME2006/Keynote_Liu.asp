<h1>Multimedia Forensics: Where Sherlock Holmes Meets Signal Processing</h1>

<h3>Date: Monday Morning, July 10<br />
Location: TBA</h3>

<h3>Presented by</h3>

<p>K. J. Ray Liu, <em>University of Maryland</em></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Every technology has its time: in the past decades, we have witnessed
advances in communication and networking infrastructure, followed by the
development of multimedia compression and coding standards, and then the
demands of content search and retrieval. This path of technological evolution
has naturally led to an unsolved critical issue, that is,  information
assurance and forensics. Multimedia forensics is to reconstruct what have
happened to the content to answer who has done what, when and how. It is an
emerging new filed seeing its horizon rising via the interdisciplinary
interactions of signal processing, cryptology, communication and information
theory, game theory, and the psychology of human visual/auditory perception.<p>

<p>In this talk, three exemplary multimedia forensic cases - namely traitor
tracing forensics, behavior forensics, and non-intrusive component forensics,
all posting different technical issues with different applications, will be
illustrated with details to highlight the excitement of Sherlock Holmes when
examining evidences for multimedia forensics via the tools of signal
processing.</p>
