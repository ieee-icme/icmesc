<h1>Machine Learning for Multi-Modality Genomic Data Mining</h1>

<h3>Date: Tuesday Morning, July 11<br />
Location: TBA</h3>

<h3>Presented by</h3>

<p>S. Y. Kung, <em>Princeton University</em></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Genomic bioinformatics represents a natural convergence of life science and
information science. The DNA sequencing and expression profiling represent two
main modalities of genomic information sources. The genome is not just a
collection of genes working in isolation, but it encompasses global and highly
coordinated control of information to carry out a range of cellular functions.
Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a genome-wide exploration.  Note that
genome-wide analysis via pure DNA sequencing is computationally prohibitive.
In contrast, expression of several thousands of genes can be measured
simultaneously by DNA microarrays, thus permitting discovery of clusters of
correlated genes.  It is obvious that microarray data analysis will play a
vital role in the future genome-wide bioinformatic study.</p>

<p>It is crucial to know not only how to cluster data but also how to find
appropriate way of looking at the genomic data.  In other words, extraction of
relevant features is critical for cluster discovery.  We shall present a
comprehensive set of coherence models to better capture the biological relevant
features of genes.  In addition, we adopt as the classification architecture
several existing neural networks, e.g. SVM or decision-based neural network
(DBNN).  Our fusion model is built upon the classic mixture-of-experts (MOE)
architecture: (1) a local expert is assigned to cover each modality;  (2) a
gating agent is then adopted to fuse the local scores to reach a Bayesian
optimal decision.    Based on the standard yeast data base, the proposed
machine learning/fusion system yields satisfactory performance in  predicting
several well-studied yeast gene groups e.g. ribosomal and molecular activities
genes.</p>

<p>With massive amount of data having to be analyzed, genomic study will become
inevitably dependent on advanced machine learning techniques.   On the other
hand, any computationally-based genomic prediction remains untrustworthy until
a careful and laborious biological verification is performed. This points to an
increasingly symbiotic relationship between the machine learning and genomic
technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Professor S.Y. Kung</strong> received his Ph.D. Degree in Electrical
Engineering from Stanford University in 1977. He was an Associate Engineer of
Amdahl Corporation, Sunnyvale, 1974, and a Professor of Electrical
Engineering-Systems of the University of Southern California, (1977-1987).
Since 1987, he has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Princeton
University. He held a Visiting Professorship at the Stanford University (1984);
and a Visiting Professorship at the Delft University of Technology (1984); a
Toshiba Chair Professorship at the Waseda University,  Japan (1984); an
Honorary Professorship at the Central China University of  Science and
Technology (1994);  and  a Distinguished Chair Professorship at the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University (2001-2003). His research interests include VLSI array
processors, system modeling and identification, neural networks, wireless
communication, sensor array processing, multimedia signal processing,
bioinformatic data mining and biometric authentication.</p>

<p>Professor Kung is a Fellow of IEEE since 1988.  He served as a Member of the
Board of Governors of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (1989-1991).  He was a
founding member of several Technical Committees (TC) of the IEEE Signal
Processing Society, including VLSI Signal Processing TC (1984), Neural Networks
for Signal Processing  TC (1991) and Multimedia Signal Processing  TC (1998),
and was appointed as the first Associate Editor in VLSI Area (1984) and later
the first Associate Editor in Neural Network (1991)  for the IEEE Transactions
on Signal Processing. He presently serves on Technical Committees on Multimedia
Signal Processing.  Since 1990, he has been the Editor-In-Chief of the Journal
of VLSI Signal Processing Systems.</p>

<p>Professor Kung has co-authored more than 400 technical publications and
numerous textbooks including "VLSI and Modern Signal Processing" with Russian
translation, Prentice-Hall (1985), ``VLSI Array Processors'', with Russian and
Chinese translations, Prentice-Hall (1988); ``Digital Neural Networks'',
Prentice-Hall (1993); ``Principal Component Neural Networks'', John-Wiley
(1996); and ``Biometric Authentication: A Machine Learning and Neural Network
Approach'', Prentice-Hall (2005).</p>

<p>Professor Kung was a recipient of IEEE Signal Processing Society's Technical
Achievement Award for his contributions on "parallel processing and neural
network algorithms for signal processing" (1992); a Distinguished Lecturer of
IEEE Signal Processing Society (1994) ; a recipient of IEEE Signal Processing
Society's Best Paper Award  for his publication on principal component neural
networks (1996); and a recipient of the IEEE Third Millennium Medal (2000).</p>
