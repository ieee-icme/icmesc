<h1>T1.2: Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Applications</h1>

<p><strong>Sunday, July 9, 2006 (09:00 - 12:00, Carmichael)</strong></p>

<h4>Instructor</h4>

<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~jinl/">Dr. Jin Li</a>, <em>Microsoft Research, USA</em></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>In both the academia and in the industries, peer-to-peer (p2p) applications
have attracted great attention. Peer-to-peer file sharing applications, such as
Napster, Gnutella, Kazaa and BitTorrent, have witnessed tremendous success
among the end users. And the uses of peer-to-peer network for multimedia
streaming, conferencing, gaming, file backup, information retrieval are on the
rise. Unlike a client-server based system, peers bring with them serving
capacity. Therefore, as the demand of a peer-to-peer system grows, the capacity
of the network grows too. This enables a peer-to-peer multimedia application to
be cheap to build and superb in scalability.</p>

<p>In this short course, we examine a number of issues associated with
successfully building and deploying a P2P multimedia application. We start by
examining the components of popular P2P applications. We then investigate a
number of tools for building P2P multimedia applications, such as the
distributed hash table (DHT), erasure coding, and P2P transport (locality
awareness, NAT/firewall traversal, and IP multicast). Finally, we move on to
critical deployment decisions that may make-or-break a P2P applications, such
as P2P economy, reputation and incentives, dealing with malicious attacks, and
privacy and security issues.</p>

<h4>Speaker Biography</h4>

<p><strong>Jin Li</strong> received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from
Tsinghua University (Beijing, China) in 1994. From 1994 to 1996, he served as a
Research Associate at the University of Southern California (USC).  From 1996
to 1999, he was a member of the technical staff at the Sharp Laboratories of
America (SLA), (Camas, WA), and represented the interests of SLA in the
JPEG2000 and MPEG4 standardization efforts. He was a researcher/project leader
at Microsoft Research Asia (Beijing, China) from 1999 to 2000. He is currently
a researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond. From 2000, Dr. Li has also served
as an adjunct professor at the electrical engineering department, Tsinghua
University (Beijing, China).</p>

<p>Dr. Li has 70+ referred conference and journal papers in a diversified
research field, with interests cover audio/image/video compression, virtual
environment and graphic compression, audio/video streaming, and realtime
audio/video conferencing. His recent interest is in peer-to-peer content
delivery applications. Dr. Li has personally built a number of P2P
applications, such as P2P web hosting, P2P streaming and P2P distributed
storage device. He was the driving force behind Microsoft’s strategy and
application development in the peer-to-peer area, and the prototype he built
may potentially change the online experience of millions of users. He holds 11
issued US patents, with many more pending. Dr. Li is an Area Editor for the
Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation (Academic Press) and
an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. He is a senior member
of IEEE. He was the recipient of the 1994 Ph.D. thesis award from Tsinghua
University and the 1998 Young Investigator Award from SPIE Visual Communication
and Image Processing.</p>
