<h1>T1.1 - Steganography and Steganalysis: Fundamentals, Algorithms and Future Research</h1>

<p><strong>Sunday, July 9, 2006 (09:00 - 12:00, Varley)</strong></p>

<h4>Instructor</h4>

<p><a href="http://web .njit.edu/~shi">Prof. Yun Q. Shi</a>, <em>New Jersey Institute of Technology, USA</em>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>Data hiding has drawn extensive interests in the past decade. The
availability of various data hiding algorithms, together prevailing digital
multimedia and transportation network, in particular Internet, has made covert
communications a reality in this digital age. In other words, modern
steganography has been feasible and can be carried out rather efficiently.  As
a result, the effective way to detect covert communications, i.e., the first
and very important step of steganalysis is called for. The applications of
steganalysis include combating illegal distribution of children pornography
that is embedded into normal images and videos and intercepting criminal covert
communications among terrorists. In addition, the steganalysis can serve as an
effective way to evaluate the security performance of various steganographic
techniques. The relationship between steganography and steganalysis is just
like that between missile and anti-missile, i.e., the measure and
countermeasure. This tutorial is to present to the audience the fundamental
concepts, the most typical algorithms and the future research issues in the
area of steganography and steganalysis. Specifically, (I) The basic concepts of
steganography and steganalysis, their meaning and applications will be
introduced. (II) The typical modern steganographic techniques such as Outguess,
F5 and MB (model-based) will be described. (III) In addition to some well-known
steganalysis schemes, the most powerful prior-art of universal steganalysis
scheme and the most powerful prior-art of steganalysis scheme aiming at
detection of steganographic techniques designed for JPEG images will be
presented. The newly developed steganalysis schemes which outperform the
above-mentioned prior-arts by a significant margin will be presented and
analyzed. (IV) Finally, the future research will be discussed.</p>
