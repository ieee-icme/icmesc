<h1>T2.4 Protection of Intellectual Property in Digital Networks</h1>

<p><strong>Sunday, July 9, 2006 (Cancelled)</strong></p>

<h4>Instructor</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~eskicioglu">Prof. Ahmet M. Eskicioglu</a>, <em>Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, USA</em></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>In recent years, advances in digital technologies have created significant
changes in the way we reproduce, distribute and market intellectual property
(IP).  Digital media can now be exploited by the IP owners to develop new and
innovative business models for their products and services.  The lowered cost
of reproduction, storage and distribution, however, also invites much
motivation for large-scale commercial infringement.  In a world where piracy is
a growing potential threat, the rights of the IP owners can be protected using
three complementary weapons:  Technology, legislation, and business models.
Because of the diversity of IP (ranging from ebooks to songs and movies), no
single solution is applicable to the protection of multimedia products in
distribution networks.</p>

<p>IP is created as a result of intellectual activities in the industrial,
scientific, literary and artistic fields.  It is divided into two general
categories:  (1)  Industrial property - includes inventions (patents),
trademarks, industrial designs, and geographic indications of source, and (2)
Copyright - includes literary and artistic works such as novels, poems and
plays, films, musical works, artistic works such as drawings, paintings,
photographs and sculptures, and architectural designs.</p>

<p>A digital home network is a cluster of digital audio/visual (A/V) devices
including set-top boxes, TVs, VCRs, DVD players, and general-purpose computing
devices such as personal computers.  Copyrighted digital multimedia content may
be delivered to the consumers from a number of sources including the Internet,
and satellite, terrestrial or cable television systems.  It may also be made
available as prepackaged media (e.g., a digital tape or a digital video disc)
at retail stores.  Before releasing their content for distribution, the content
owners may require protection by specifying certain access conditions and
digital rights.  Although legal institutions exist for protecting intellectual
property, complimentary technical measures are needed to sustain financial
returns and to ensure incentives for new creations.  Recently, two fundamental
groups of technologies, encryption and watermarking, have been identified for
protecting copyrighted multimedia content in digital distribution networks.
Encryption-based technologies transform content into unintelligible form.  This
transformation, being reversible in nature, allows perfect recovery of content
before consumption.  Technologies based on watermarking embed data directly
into content, resulting in imperceptible degradation in visual quality.</p>

<p>End-to-end security is the most critical requirement for the creation of new
digital markets where copyrighted multimedia content is a key product.  Three
major industries have a vital interest in this problem: The motion picture
industry, the consumer electronics (CE) industry, and the information
technology (IT) industry.  This tutorial is an overview of the work done for
protecting the content owners’ investment in intellectual property.  After an
introduction to copyright and copyright industries, we examine how the
technological, legal, and business solutions help maintain the incentive to
supply the lifeblood of the markets.</p>

<h4>Speaker Biography</h4>

<p><strong>Ahmet M. Eskicioglu</strong> received the B.S. degree from the
Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, and the M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
(UMIST), England.   He was with the Computer Engineering Department, METU from
1983 to 1992, the Department of Computer Sciences, University of North Texas
from 1992 to 1995, and Thomson Multimedia Corporate Research, Indianapolis from
1996 to 2001.</p>

<p>Dr. Eskicioglu is with the Department of Computer and Information Science,
Brooklyn College of the City University of New York.   He has actively
participated in the development of several national and international standards
for copy protection and conditional access in the US and Europe.  These
standards include the Content Scramble System (CSS) for DVD players, the
Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) conditional access system
architecture, the Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA) National Renewable
Security Standard (NRSS), and the European Union’s Digital Video Broadcasting
(DVB) Content Protection and Copy Management (CPCM) System.  He was the chair
of Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) Working Group on Copy Protection, a
member of the Copy Protection Technical Working Group (CPTWG), Advanced
Television Systems Committee (ATSC) T3/S8 Conditional Access Ad Hoc Working
Group, EIA and National Cable Television Association (NCTA) Joint Engineering
Committee National Renewable Security Standard (NRSS) Subcommittee, and Society
of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) Digital Video Subcommittee.</p>

<p>Dr. Eskicioglu holds several patents on copy protection, conditional access,
and digital interface protection.  Recently, he co-authored two book chapters
entitled “Protection of Multimedia Content in Distribution Networks” and
“Fundamentals of Multimedia Encryption Techniques” published in Multimedia
Security Handbook by CRC Press in 2005.  He has also written two other book
chapters:  “Key Management for Multimedia Access and Distribution” to appear in
Multimedia Security Technologies for Digital Rights Management that will be
published by Elsevier, and “Protection of Multimedia Data in Distribution and
Storage” to appear in Encyclopedia of Multimedia that will be published by
Springer.  Currently, he is writing a textbook entitled “Security of multimedia
content: Technical solutions, legislation, and business models” that will be
published by Wiley.</p>

<p>Dr. Eskicioglu’s teaching and research interests include data security,
conditional access, digital rights management, copy protection, digital
watermarking, and multimedia applications.  He has been a National Science
Foundation panelist, and a guest lecturer at several universities and research
organizations.</p>
