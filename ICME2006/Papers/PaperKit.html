<h2><a name="PartI"></a>Part I: General Information</h2>

<h4><a name="Procedure"></a>Procedure</h4>

<p>The ICME 2006 paper submission and review process is being conducted in a
manner similar to previous ICME conferences:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Authors who wish to participate in the conference will create documents
  consisting of a complete description of their ideas and applicable research
  results in a maximum of 4 pages.</li>
  
  <li>Submit the paper electronically and copyright form by fax. This paper
  submission must be submitted in final, publishable form before the submission
  deadline listed below.</li>
  
	<li>Check the ICME 2006 website for the status of your paper.</li>

  <li>Paper submissions will be reviewed by experts selected by the conference
  committee for their demonstrated knowledge of particular topics.  The
  progress and results of the review process will be posted on this website,
  and authors will also be notified of the review results by email.</li>

  <li>Prepare a lecture or poster presentation following the guidelines
  included in this document.</li>

</ul>

<p>The review process is being conducted entirely online. To make the review
process easy for the reviewers, and to assure that the paper submissions will
be readable through the online review system, we ask that authors submit paper
documents that are formatted according to the Paper Kit instructions included
here.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h4>

<p>Papers may be no longer than 4 pages, including all text, figures, and references.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted by the deadline date. There will be no exceptions.</p>

<p>Accepted papers <strong>MUST</strong> be presented at the conference by one
of the authors, or, if none of the authors are able to attend, by a qualified
surrogate. The presenter <strong>MUST</strong> register for the conference at
one of the non-student rates offered, and <strong>MUST</strong> register before
the deadline given for author registration. Failure to register before the
deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of your paper from the conference
proceedings and program.</p>

<div class="sepbig"></div>

<h2><a name="PartII"></a>Part II: Preparation of the Paper</h2>

<h4><a name="DocumentFormatting"></a>Document Formatting</h4>

<p>Use the following guidelines when preparing your document:</p>

<p><span class="important">LENGTH: You are allowed a total of 4 pages for your
document. This is the maximum number of pages that will be accepted, including
all figures, tables, and references.</span> Any documents that exceed the 4
page limit will be rejected.</p>

<p><strong>LANGUAGE</strong>: All proposals must be in English.</p>

<p><strong>MARGINS</strong>: Documents should be formatted for standard
<strong>letter-size (8-1/2" by 11" or 216mm by 279mm) paper</strong>. Any text
or other material outside the margins specified below will not be accepted:</p>

<ul>

  <li>All text and figures must be contained in a 178 mm x 229 mm (7 inch x 9
  inch) image area.</li>
  
  <li>The left margin must be 19 mm (0.75 inch).</li>
  
  <li>The top margin must be 25 mm (1.0 inch), except for the title page
  where it must be 35 mm (1.375 inches).</li>
  
  <li>Text should appear in two columns, each 86 mm (3.39 inch) wide with 6
  mm (0.24 inch) space between columns.</li>
  
  <li>On the first page, the top 50 mm (2") of both columns is reserved for
  the title, author(s), and affiliation(s). These items should be centered
  across both columns, starting at 35 mm (1.375 inches) from the top of the
  page.</li>
  
  <li>The paper abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of
  text, about 12 mm (0.5") below the title area and no more than 80 mm
  (3.125") in length. Leave 12 mm (0.5") of space between the end of the
  abstract and the beginning of the main text.</li>

</ul>

<div class="sidebar">

<p>A format sheet with the margins and placement guides is available in the
following file formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="PaperFormat/format.pdf">PDF file</a> (When you print this file, make sure the "shrink to fit" box is not checked!)</li>
  <li><a href="PaperFormat/format.ps">PostScript file</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These files contain lines and boxes showing the margins and print areas. If
you print one of these files, then stack it atop your printed page and hold it
up to the light, you can easily check your margins to see if your print area
fits within the space allowed.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>TYPE</strong>:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
  <p><strong>Face</strong>: To achieve the best viewing experience for the
  review process and conference proceedings, we strongly encourage authors to
  use Times-Roman or Computer Modern fonts. If a font face is used that is not
  recognized by the submission system, your proposal will not be reproduced
  correctly.</p>

  <p><strong>Size</strong>: Use a font size that is no smaller than 9 points
  throughout the paper, including figure captions. In 9-point type font,
  capital letters are 2 mm high. For 9-point type font, there should be no more
  than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically. This is a minimum spacing; 2.75
  lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make the proposal much more readable. Larger
  type sizes require correspondingly larger vertical spacing.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>TITLE</strong>: The paper title must appear in boldface letters and
should be in Title Case (each non-minor word should begin with a capital
letter).  Do not use LaTeX math notation ($x_y$) in the title; the title must
be representable in the Unicode character set. Also try to avoid uncommon
acronyms in the title.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR LIST</strong>: The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear
below the title in capital and lower case letters.  Proposals with multiple
authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information.
The order of the authors on the document should exactly match in number and
order the authors typed into the online submission form.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: Each paper should contain an abstract of 100 to
150 words that appears at the beginning of the document. Use the same text that
is submitted electronically along with the author contact information.</p>

<p><strong>BODY</strong>: Major headings appear in boldface CAPITAL letters,
centered in the column. Subheadings appear in capital and lower case, either
underlined or in boldface. They start at the left margin of the column on a
separate line.  Sub-subheadings are discouraged, but if they must be used, they
should appear in capital and lower case, and start at the left margin on a
separate line. They may be underlined or in italics.</p>

<p><strong>REFERENCES</strong>: List and number all references at the end of
the document. The references can be numbered in alphabetical order or in order
of appearance in the paper. When referring to them in the text, type the
corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this
sentence [1].  The end of the document should include a list of references
containing information similar to the following example:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">[1] D. E. Ingalls, "Image Processing for Experts," IEEE Trans. ASSP, vol. ASSP-36, pp. 1932-1948, 1988.</p>

<p><strong>ILLUSTRATIONS &amp; COLOR</strong>: Illustrations must appear within
the designated margins. They may span the two columns. If possible, position
illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in the middle or at the
bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must
be clear in black and white. Since the printed proceedings will be produced in
black and white, be sure that your images are acceptable when printed in black
and white (the CD-ROM and IEEE Xplore proceedings will retain the colors in
your document).</p>

<p><span class="important">PAGE NUMBERS: <strong>Do not put page numbers on
your document</strong>. Appropriate page numbers will be added to accepted
papers when the conference proceedings are assembled.</span></p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Templates"></a>Templates</h4>

<p>The following style files and templates are available for users of LaTeX and Microsoft Word:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="PaperFormat/spconf.sty">LaTeX style file with margin, page layout, font, etc. definitions.</a></li>
	<li><a href="PaperFormat/IEEEbib.bst">BiBTeX style file with bibliography style definitions.</a></li>
	<li><a href="PaperFormat/Template.tex">LaTeX template file, an example of using the "spconf.sty" and "IEEEbib.bst" files above.</a></li>
	<li><a href="PaperFormat/Template.pdf">PDF generated from the template file.</a></li>
	<li><a href="PaperFormat/WordTemplate.doc">Word 97/2000 Sample, a template of correct formatting and font use.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend that you use the Word file or LaTeX files to produce your
document, since they have been set up to meet the formatting guidelines listed
above.  When using these files, double-check the paper size in your page setup
to make sure you are using the letter-size paper layout (8.5" X 11").  The
LaTeX environment files specify suitable margins, page layout, text, and a
bibliography style.</p>

<p>In particular, with LaTeX, there are cases where the top-margin of the
resulting Postscript or PDF file does not meet the specified parameters. In
this case, you may need to add a <span style="font-family:monospace;">\topmargin=0mm</span>
command just after the <span style="font-family:monospace;">\begin{document}</span> command in your
.tex file. The spacing of the top margin is not critical, as the page contents
will be adjusted on the proceedings. The critical dimensions are the actual
width and height of the page content.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="PDFExpress"></a>Using IEEE's PDF Express to check your PDFs</h4>

<p>ISBI 2006 has registered for use of a new IEEE tool: IEEE PDF eXpress™</p>

<p>IEEE PDF eXpress is a free service to IEEE conferences, allowing their authors to make IEEE Xplore-compatible PDFs (Conversion function) or to check PDFs that authors have made themselves for IEEE Xplore compatibility (PDF Check function).</p>

<p>Steps for checking or converting PDFs using IEEE PDF Express:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create your manuscript(s)</li>
  <li>Proofread and check layout of manuscript (it is highly recommended that you do this BEFORE going to IEEE PDF eXpress.)</li>
  <li>Create IEEE PDF eXpress account</li>
  <li>Upload source file(s) for Conversion; and/or PDF(s) for Checking</li>
  <li>Use IEEE PDF eXpress to attain IEEE Xplore-compatible PDF(s). The site contains extensive instructions, resources, helpful hints, and access to technical support.</li>
  <li>Submit final, IEEE Xplore-compatible PDF(s) per the instructions in Part III below. <strong>Uploading a paper to IEEE PDF Express is not the same as submitting the paper to the symposium for review. You will still need to submit the checked PDF by the normal means.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<div class="sepbig"></div>

<h2><a name="PartIII"></a>Part III: Submission and Review of the Paper</h2>

<p>The review process will be performed from the electronic submission of your
paper. To ensure that your document is compatible with the review system,
please adhere to the following compatibility requirements:</p>

<h4><a name="FileFormat"></a>File Format</h4>

<p class="important">The 'IEEE Requirements for PDF Documents' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST be
followed EXACTLY</span>. The conference is required to ensure that documents
follow this specification. The requirements are enumerated in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="PaperFormat/Author-PDF-Guide-V32.pdf">IEEE Requirements for PDF Documents v3.2</a> [PDF]</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers must be submitted in either PostScript (PS) or Adobe's Portable Document
Format (PDF) format.</p>

<p>PDF and Postscript files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must not have Adobe Document Protection or Document Security enabled,</li>
  <li>must have either 'US Letter' or 'A4' sized pages,</li>
  <li>must be in first-page-first order, and</li>
  <li>must have <strong>ALL FONTS</strong> embedded and subset.</li>
</ul>
    
<p class="important">ALL FONTS MUST be embedded in the PDF or PostScript file.
There is no guarantee that the viewers of the paper (reviewers and those who
view the proceedings CD-ROM after publication) have the same fonts used in the
document.  If fonts are not embedded in the submission, you will be contacted
by CMS and asked to submit a file that has all fonts embedded.  Please refer to
your PDF or PS file generation utility's user guide to find out how to embed
all fonts.</p>

<div class="sidebar">

<h4><a name="LaTeXInfo"></a>Information for LaTeX users</h4>

<p>Generating a PostScript file is straightforward for all LaTeX
packages we are aware of. When preparing the proposal under LaTeX, it is
preferable to use scalable fonts such as Type I, Computer Modern. However,
quite good results can be obtained with the fonts defined in the style file
recommended above (spconf.sty).</p>

<p>PDF files with Postscript Type 3 fonts are highly discouraged. PDF and
PostScript files utilizing Type 3 fonts are typically produced by the LaTeX
system and are lower-resolution bitmapped versions of the letters and figures.
It is possible to perform a few simple changes to the configuration or
command-line to produce files that use PostScript Type 1 fonts, which are a
vector representation of the letters and figures. An excellent set of
instructions is found at:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
  <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~cantrell/online/543e.html">Creating quality Adobe PDF files from TeX with DVIPS</a>
</div>

<p>For most installations of LaTeX, you can cause
<span style="font-family:monospace;">dvips</span> to output Type 1 fonts
instead of Type 3 fonts by including <span style="font-family:monospace;">-Ppdf</span> option to
<span style="font-family:monospace;">dvips</span>. The resulting Postscript file will
reference the Type 1 Computer Modern fonts, rather than embedding the bitmapped
Type 3 versions, which cause problems with printers.</p>

<p>You may also need to tell <span style="font-family: monospace;">dvips</span> to force
letter sized paper with the option: <span style="font-family: monospace;">-t letter</span>.</p>

<p>Some LaTeX installations also include <span
style="font-family:monospace;">pdflatex</span>, which produces acceptable PDF files as well.</p>

</div>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="CreatingPS"></a>Creating a Postscript (PS) File</h4>

<p>Windows users: To save a document as a PostScript file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install and select a PostScript printer driver.  We recommend <A href="http://www.adobe.org/support/downloads/pdrvwin.htm">Adobe Systems' PostScript Driver</a>.</li>
  <li>In your word processor, on the File menu, click Print.</li>
  <li>Select the PostScript printer which will be used to generate the file.</li>
  <li>Select the Print to File check box, and then click OK.</li>
  <li>In the File name box, type a file name. The file is saved with a '.prn' extension by default. Rename the file to give it the extension '.ps'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Macintosh users: To save a document as a PostScript file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install and select a PostScript printer driver.  We recommend <a href="http://www.adobe.org/support/downloads/pdrvmac.htm">Adobe Systems' PostScript Driver</a>.</li>
  <li>In your word processor, on the File&gt;Print menu, click General.</li>
  <li>Go down to "Save as File."</li>
  <li>Make the following selections:
  <ul>
    <li>Format: PostScript Job</li>
    <li>PostScript Level: Level 1 Compatible</li>
    <li>Data Format: BINARY</li>
    <li>Font Inclusion: All</li>
    <li>Destination: File</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Click "Save" and specify a file name.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="FileSizeLimit"></a>File Size Limit</h4>

<p>Authors will be permitted to submit a document file up to 3 MB (megabytes) in
size.  To request an exception, contact the paper submission technical support
at: <a href="mailto:papers@icme2006.org">papers@icme2006.org</a>.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="FileName"></a>File Name</h4>

<p>The filename of the document file should be the first author's last name,
followed by the appropriate extension (.ps or .pdf). For example, if the first
author's name is Johan Smith, you would submit your file as "smith.ps" or
"smith.pdf". To speed transmission of your PostScript and PDF files, you may
use a compression utility that will produce compressed archives that are 100%
compatible with the ZIP compression format defined by PKWare or the GZip format
common on UNIX and Linux systems. Such a utility can be downloaded from
PKWare's website at: <a href="http://www.pkware.org">www.pkware.org</a>. This
compression is not required, but it is allowed and encouraged so that file
transfer times may be reduced. If you do submit a compressed version of the
document file, use the same filename specification mentioned earlier, with the
appropriate file extension (for example, "smith.zip" or "smith.gz"). The paper
submission process will append the filename with a unique identifier when it is
stored on our system, so multiple submissions with the same name will not
overwrite each other and will be distinguishable.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Submission"></a>Electronic Paper Submission</h4>

<p>When you have your document file ready, gather the following information
before entering the submission system:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Document file in PDF or PS format</li>
	<li>Affiliation, email address, and mailing address for each author</li>
	<li>Paper title</li>
	<li>Text file containing paper abstract text, in ASCII text format (for copying and pasting into web page form)</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit your document and author information, go to the 'Paper Submission'
link on the ICME 2006 homepage: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.icme2006.org/">http://www.icme2006.org/</a></p>

<p>The submission system will present an entry form to allow you to enter the
paper title, abstract text, review category, and author contact information.</p>

<p class="important">ALL authors must be entered in the online form, and must
appear in the online form in the same order in which the authors appear on the
PDF.</p>

<p>After you submit this information, the system will display a page with the
data that you entered so that you may verify its accuracy.  If you need to
change the data to fix a mistake, you may use the back button on your browser
to return to the information entry form.  Once you approve of the data that you
have entered, you may choose your document file for upload at the bottom of the
verification page.  When you click on the button labeled 'Continue' at the
bottom of this page, the page will check the filename extension to make sure it
matches the submission criteria, then your browser will upload your file to our
server.  Depending on the size of your file and your internet connection speed,
this upload may take a few minutes.  At the end of a successful upload, you
will see a confirmation page displaying the paper number that is assigned to
you, and and email message will be sent to the authors' email addresses to
confirm that the file has been uploaded.  If you do not see the confirmation
page after uploading your file, we may not have successfully received your file
upload.  If you encounter trouble, contact the paper submission support at:
<a href="mailto:papers@icme2006.org">papers@icme2006.org</a>.</p>  

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="CopyrightForm"></a>IEEE Copyright Transfer Form</h4>

<p>The confirmation page that is displayed after uploading your document file
will also generate an IEEE copyright form for your paper that you MUST print,
sign, and fax to us.  We will also accepted emailed versions in PDF or JPEG
format, but they must be scans. IEEE does not accepted electronically signed
copyright transfer forms.  Our fax number will also be provided in the
submission system.  If you have difficulty faxing your copyright form, please
contact the paper submission support at:
<a href="mailto:copyright@icme2006.org">copyright@icme2006.org</a>.</p>

<p>The copyright form must be received by us before the paper submission
deadline. In the even your paper is not accepted, the form becomes null and
void.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="ReviewProcess"></a>Online Review Process</h4>

<p>Your submitted paper will be converted to PDF format by the submission
system if necessary, then visually inspected by our submission system staff to
assure that the document is readable and meets all formatting requirements to
be included in a visually pleasing and consistant proceedings publication for
ICME 2006.  If our submission inspectors encounter errors with your submitted
file, they will contact you to resolve the issue.  If your paper passes
inspection, it will be entered into the review process.  A committee of
reviewers selected by the conference committee will review the documents and
rate them according to quality, relevence, and correctness.  The conference
technical committee will use these reviews to determine which papers will be
accepted for presentation in the conference.  The result of the technical
committee's decision will be communicated to the submitting authors by email,
along with any reviewer comments, if any.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="MonitorStatus"></a>Monitor Your Submission Status</h4>

<p>After you submit your document, you may monitor the status of your paper as
it progresses through the submission and review process by using the Paper
Status website available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icme2006.org/Papers.asp">http://www.icme2006.org/Papers.asp</a></p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Notification"></a>Notification of Acceptance</h4>

<p>Authors will be notified of paper acceptance or non-acceptance by email as
close as possible to the published author notification date. The email
notification will include the presentation format chosen for your paper
(lecture or poster) and may also include the presentation date and time, if
available.</p>

<p>The notification email will include comments from the reviewers. The
conference cannot guarantee that all of the reviewers will provide the level of
comment desired by you. However, reviewers are encouraged to submit as detailed
comments as possible.</p>

<p>Because of the short amount of time between paper acceptance decisions and
the beginning of the publication process, ICME 2006 is not able to allow for
a two-way discourse between the authors and the reviewers of a paper. If there
appears to be a logistical error in the reviewer comments, such as the reviewer
commenting on the wrong paper, etc., please contact ICME 2006 at
<a href="mailto:papers@icme2006.org">papers@icme2006.org</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="AuthorRegistration"></a>Required Author Registration</h4>

<p>Be sure that at least one author registers to attend the conference using
the online registration system available through the conference website.  Each
paper must have at least one author registered, with the <strong>payment
received</strong> by the author registration deadline (see above) to avoid
being withdrawn from the conference.</p>

<h2><a name="PartIV"></a>Part IV: Preparation of the Presentation</h2>

<p>To help authors prepare for lecture
and poster presentations, the following suggestions have been created:</p>

<h4><a name="LecturePresentations"></a>Lecture Presentations</h4>

<p><strong>PRESENTATION TIME</strong>: Presentation time is critical; each paper is allocated 20 minutes for lecture
sessions. We recommend that presentation of your slides should take about 17-18
minutes, leaving 2-3 minutes for introduction, summary, and questions from the
audience. To achieve appropriate timing, organize your slides or viewgraphs
around the points you intend to make, using no more than one slide per minute.
A reasonable strategy is to allocate about 2 minutes per slide when there are
equations or important key points to make, and one minute per slide when the
content is less complex. Slides attract and hold attention, and reinforce what
you say - provided you keep them simple and easy to read. Plan on covering at
most 6 points per slide, covered by 6 to 12 spoken sentences and no more than
about two spoken minutes.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS</strong>: Make sure each of your key points is
easy to explain with aid of the material on your slides. Do not read directly
from the slide during your presentation. You shouldn't need to prepare a
written speech, although it is often a good idea to prepare the opening and
closing sentences in advance. It is <strong>very</strong> important that you
rehearse your presentation in front of an audience before you give your
presentation at ICME. Surrogate presenters <strong>must</strong> be
sufficiently familiar with the material being presented to answer detailed
questions from the audience. In addition, the surrogate presenter must contact
the Session Chair in advance of the presenter's session.</p>

<p><strong>EQUIPMENT PROVIDED</strong>: A computer-driven slideshow for use
with a data projector is recommended for your talk at ICME. All presentation
rooms will be equipped with a computer, a data projector, a microphone (for
large rooms), a lectern, and a pointing device. An overhead projector will be
provided upon request.</p>

<p>Each presenter is expected to preload the presentation in the
laptop computer at the <strong>beginning</strong> of the respective session.</p>

<p><strong>VISUAL AIDS</strong>: Some of the lecture presentations will be
given in quite large lecture halls. We recommend that you prepare your slides
according to the following guidelines to ensure that the entire audience will
be able to see your presentation.  Your Session Chair might contact you in
advance of the conference to request copies of your visual aids for approval
before the conference.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">

<p><strong>Transparencies</strong> (viewgraphs) should be oriented vertically.
Their contents should fit within a rectangle 19cm wide by 23cm high. Lettering:
A minimum font (type) size of 24 point (capital letters at least 6mm high)
should be used, set in a "sans serif" font (for example "cmss" in the Computer
Modern family or the "Helvetica" PostScript font).  Spacing: A
<strong>minimum</strong> of 5mm of blank space should be left between lines;
more is preferable. Leave as much "white space" as possible to make them easily
readable. Following these guidelines, you will easily be able to put as much
information on the viewgraph as your audience can absorb in one minute.
Remember, you can expand upon some points in your lecture presentation; the
viewgraphs need not contain every minor piece of information.  It is more
important that they be easily readable by the audience.</p>

<h4><a name="PosterPresentations"></a>Poster Presentations</h4>

<p>Poster sessions are a good medium for authors to present papers and meet
with interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions. In addition,
attendees find the poster sessions a good way to sample many papers in parallel
sessions. Thus it is important that you display your message clearly and
noticeably to attract people who might have an interest in your paper.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS</strong>: Your poster should cover the key
points of your work. It need not, and should not, attempt to include all the
details; you can describe them in person to people who are interested. The
ideal poster is designed to attract attention, provide a brief overview of your
work, and initiate discussion.  Carefully and completely prepare your poster
well in advance of the conference.  Try tacking up the poster before you leave
for the conference to see what it will look like and to make sure that you have
all of the necessary pieces.</p>

<p><strong>DIMENSIONS</strong>: For your poster, a board will be provided which
measures <strong>4ft. tall by 6ft. wide (landscape
orientation)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>FORMATTING</strong>: The title of your poster should appear at the
top in CAPITAL letters about 25mm high. Below the title put the author(s)'
name(s) and affiliation(s). The flow of your poster should be from the top left
to the bottom right. Use arrows to lead your viewer through the poster. Use
color for highlighting and to make your poster more attractive.  Use pictures,
diagrams, cartoons, figures, etc., rather than text wherever possible. Try to
state your main result in 6 lines or less, in lettering about 15mm high so that
people can read the poster from a distance. The smallest text on your poster
should be at least 9mm high, and the important points should be in a larger
size. Use a sans-serif font (such as "cmss" in the Computer Modern family or
the "Helvetica" PostScript font) to make the print easier to read from a
distance.</p>

<p>Make your poster as self-explanatory as possible. This will save your
efforts for technical discussions. There will not be any summaries given at the
beginning of the poster sessions at ICME 2006, so authors need not prepare
any overhead slides for their poster presentations. You may bring additional
battery-operated audio or visual aids to enhance your presentation.</p>

<p><strong>TIME</strong>: Prepare a short presentation of about 5 or 10 minutes
that you can periodically give to those assembled around your poster throughout
the <strong>1 hour</strong> poster session. If possible, more than one author should attend the
session to aid in presentations and discussions, and to provide the presenters
with the chance to rest or briefly view other posters.</p>
