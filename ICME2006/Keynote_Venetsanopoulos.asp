<h1>Multimedia Signal Processing and Content-Based Image Retrieval (a Survey)</h1>

<h3>Date: Monday Afternoon, July 10<br />
Location: TBA</h3>

<h3>Presented by</h3>

<p>Anastasios (Tas) N. Venetsanopoulos, <em>University of Toronto</em></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The signal processing landscape has become vastly changed with the advent of
high speed communications systems which permit the transmission of more than
just voice and signaling data, but also images, video and virtually all
possible data combinations.  This multimedia communication environment has
resulted in the need for new and different processing tools and applications,
aimed at providing increased efficiency, convenience, productivity and
flexibility.  In this talk, a broad overview of multimedia and its impact will
be provided.  The challenges which arise in our specific area of multimedia,
that of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) will be presented and some areas
of application in relation to MPEG-7 will be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Anastasios (Tas) N. Venetsanopoulos</strong> received the
Bachelors of Engineering degree from the National Technical University in
Athens (NTU), Greece, in 1965, and the M.S., P.Phil., and Ph.D. degrees in
Electrical Engineering from Yale University in 1966, 1968, and 1969
respectively.  He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of Toronto, Canada, in September 1968 and was appointed
Inaugural Chairholder of The Bell Canada Chair in Multimedia in 1999.  Between
2001-2006 he was the Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering of
the University of Toronto.</p>

<p>He has published over 800 papers on digital signal and image processing and
digital communications and has served as Chair on numerous boards, councils and
technical conference committees including IEEE committees such as the Toronto
Section (1977-1979) and the IEEE Central Canada Council (1980-1982); he was
President of the Canadian Society for Electrical Engineering and Vice-President
of the Engineering Institute of Canada (1983-1986).  He was Guest Editor and
Associate Editor for numerous IEEE journals, and the Editor of the Canadian
Electrical Engineering Journal (1981-1983).</p>

<p>He is a member of the IEEE Communications, Circuits and Systems, Computer,
and Signal Processing Societies, as well as a member of Sigma Xi, the Technical
Chamber of Greece, the European Association of Signal Processing, and the
Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario (PEO).  He was elected as a
Fellow of the IEEE “for contributions to digital signal and image processing”,
Fellow of EIC, “for contributions to electrical engineering”, and was awarded
an Honorary Doctorate from the National Technical University of Athens, in
October 1994.  In October 1996, he was awarded the “Excellence in Innovation
Award” of the Information Technology Research Centre of Ontario and Royal Bank
of Canada, “for innovative work in colour image processing and its industrial
applications”.  In 2003, he was awarded the IEEE MacNaughton Medal, “for
outstanding contributions to the design and implementation of communication
systems, digital filters and multimedia systems; IEEE; the engineering
profession and society at large”.  In 2006 he was selected as the joint
recipient of the 2003 IEEE Transactions On Neural Networks Outstanding Paper
Award.</p>
