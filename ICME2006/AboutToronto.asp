<h1>About Toronto</h1>

<div id="AboutToronto">

<h2>WELCOME TO TORONTO</h2>

in North America.  Toronto is a city with a long history of multiculturalism
and growth, tempered with a sense of community and tradition that has allowed
Toronto to become one of the greatest cities in the world, with strong
influences from many sources melding into a unique whole.  Situated on the
shores of Lake Ontario, Toronto is farther south than many American cities, but
it’s nature is distinctly Canadian despite its proximity to the States.  An
amalgam of six smaller cities that originally became affiliated in 1953 to ease
population growth after the second World War, in 1998 the individual sections
of Toronto were officially combined into what is today called the city of
Toronto.</p>

<p>Toronto is also a strong force in the arts, whether musical or visual, live
or recorded.  With a progressive spirit and a sense of its identity and
promising future, Toronto is quickly becoming one of the best known and loved
cities in the world today.</p>

<h2>TAXATION</h2>

<p>Most goods and services in Canada are taxed 7% by the federal government and
appears on the bill as the TPS tax or also known as GST. In addition to this
tax, Quebec also charges an 8% provincial tax on goods and services, including
hotel accommodations. This tax appears as the PST. The total tax on most goods
and services is thus 15%. Visitors to Toronto from outside the country can
apply to have both the federal and provincial tax returned to them upon their
departure. Be sure to keep all purchase receipts as proof of payment. This
application form can be found in the Tax Refund for Visitors to Canada booklet.
It’s available at most hotels, Tourist Information Centers, travel agents,
duty-free shops, and shopping centers. You can also call the Visitor Rebate
Program (800) 668-4748 (within Canada) or (902) 432-5608 (outside Canada); or
visit the website: <a href="http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca" target="_blank">www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca</a>.</p>

<h2>GETTING AROUND</h2>

<h3>Public Transportation</h3>

<p>The subway system is an efficient and safe way to get around Toronto. The
subway operates from Monday to Friday 6 am to 1:30 am, and Sunday 9 am to 1:30
am.  Outside of these hours, a surface route known as the Blue Night Network
runs roughly every 30 minutes.  The subway system consists of a north-south
line (Yonge-University-Spadina) and an east-west line (Bloor-Danforth). The
system is interconnected with the bus and streetcar network, and transfer
tickets can be picked up at the stations or from a bus driver, which is cheaper
than buying separate tickets for each mode of transportation.  Free system maps
(also known as ride guides) can be obtained at any subway station to provide
complete route information. For more information about the subway system call

<h2>NEIGHBORHOODS</h2>

<h3>Toronto Islands</h3>

<p>These islands, which were originally a peninsula until a storm separated
them in 1858, cover approximately 600 acres south of Toronto’s harbor.  They
once held opulent hotels and retreats for high society, but today they are home
to shady biking and hiking trails, tennis courts, picnic sites and an
old-fashioned amusement park complete with a carousel.  The islands are a
20-minute ferry ride from the city, and are known to give a spectacular view of
the Toronto skyline.  For those seeking more exercise, bikes can be rented
onsite.</p>

<h3>Yorkville</h3>

<p><em>Yorkville Ave. Between Yonge St. &amp; Avenue Rd.</em></p>

<p>Although this neighborhood was once showing its age, recent renovations and
investments have transformed it into one of the most fashionable and chic areas
of the city.  The Victorian houses that line the streets have been converted
into cafes, salons and shops catering to upscale patrons.  These tree-lined
avenues provide a perfect place for a quiet afternoon of shopping or simply
enjoying the city.</p>

<h3>Cabbagetown</h3>

<p><em>East of Parliament St., between Wellesley &amp; Dundas St. East</em></p>

<p>Originally a poor immigrant neighborhood, Cabbagetown’s named is thought to
come from the many cabbages sprouting in the front-yard gardens of the area.
Today, however, Cabbagetown is a network of green spaces, trees and renovated
homes.  Due to the ethnically diverse background of the area, restaurants
include such fare as Ethiopian, Chinese, French, Japanese and more.  The area
also includes the 19th century Riverdale Farm, Allan Gardens, and many colorful
shops.</p>

<h3>Chinatown</h3>

<p><em>Dundas St. from Elizabeth St. to Spadina Ave.</em></p>

<p>Toronto’s Chinatown is the center of one of the largest Chinese districts in
North America.  Street vendors, especially produce sellers, fill the streets
and byways of the area.  Asian foods and goods are sold from many stores and
restaurants, and the smells of cooking and flower shops fill the streets.  This
is an excellent neighborhood for a day visit or a stroll through the city.</p>

<h3>Greektown</h3>

<p><em>Danforth Ave., between Chester St. &amp; Broadview Ave.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.greektowntoronto.com" target="_blank">www.greektowntoronto.com</a></p>

<p>Similar to Chinatown in some ways, the streets of Greektown also bustle with
vendors and fruit markets.  Trendy shops and cafes line the avenues festooned
with the Greek flag.  This family-friendly area is known for its welcoming
nature, pastry shops, and memorable sights.</p>


<h3>Kensington Market</h3>

<p><em>Kensington Ave., west of Spadina Ave. and north of Dundas St.</em></p>

<p>What was once a Jewish marketplace has become a home for the Portuguese,
Carribean and East Indian communities of Toronto, creating an atmosphere like
no other.  Everything from imported food boutiques to vintage clothing shops to
fruit and vegetable stands can be found along the streets of Kensington Market.</p>

<h3>Little India</h3>

<p><em>Gerrard St. between Woodfield &amp; Coxwell</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gerrardindianbazaar.com" target="_blank">www.gerrardindianbazaar.com</a></p>

<p>Also known as the Gerrard Indian Bazaar, this stretch of Gerrard St.
contains over one hundred Indian, Pakistani, Sr Lankan and Bangladeshi stores.
Food markets and jewelry shops abound, but the area is known for its fabric
stores and clothing shops featuring saris and other traditional fashions.  Over
50 Indian restaurants occupy the Bazaar, and many of them feature live
performances of classical Indian music.</p>

<h3>Little Italy</h3>

<p><em>College St. from Euclid Ave. to Shaw St.</em></p>

<p>This Italian district has recently become one of the city’s nighttime hot
spots, with a variety of trendy bars and restaurants.  The area is dense with
restaurants and bistros, and often full of revelers.  For a quieter
urban-Italian experience, the smaller neighborhood of Corso Italia may be more
appropriate. (St. Clair Ave., west of Bathurst St. To Lansdowne Ave.)  Slightly
to the north of Little Italy, this region is a more “traditional” Italian
neighborhood, interspersed with family-run restaurants and cafes.</p>

<h3>The Beaches</h3>

<p><em>Eastern Queen St.</em></p>

<p>This quiet community has a small-town feel that makes it a favorite of
baby-boomers, whether they are visiting or local.  Quirky shops and antique
stores combined with a boardwalk bordering a lake make this an excellent area
for a relaxed day trip inside the city.</p>

<h3>Queen Street West</h3>

<p><em>Western Queen St.</em></p>

<p>The home and headquarters of the hip and fashionable, Queen Street West is a
favorite of students, social climbers and bohemians alike.  Clothing designers
and fabric outlets rub shoulders here with second-hand bookstores and the
cutting edge of the Toronto music scene.  This funky neighborhood is sure to be
a favorite of those who like the young nightlife.</p>

<h2>PLACES TO EXPLORE</h2>

<p>Every corner of Toronto is filled with exciting and memorable things to
explore and experience.  Below are listed just a few of the things that make
Toronto popular with tourists from around the world.  For more suggestions,
visit <a href="http://www.torontotourism.com" target="_blank">www.torontotourism.com</a>. </p>

<p><strong>CN Tower</strong> The CN Tower is the tallest free-standing
structure in the world, measuring 180 stories (553 m/1815 ft) at its tip.  The
glass floored areas, turbo elevator and revolving restaurant make visiting the
Tower and unforgettable experience.</p>

<p><strong>Roy Thomson Hall</strong> This concert hall has been designed to
provide the best possible acoustic environment for anything that is performed
there.  Outfitted with the most sophisticated acoustic technologies and an
interior shape that can change to suit different performance styles, the Roy
Thomson Hall is fascinating to visit even when there is no performance
scheduled.</p>

<p><strong>Royal Ontario Museum</strong> The Royal Ontario Museum contains so
many treasures that it would be impossible to see them all in a single visit.
From ancient Egyptian antiquities and European suits of armor to dinosaur
skeletons and totem poles, this museum holds something in its four levels and
fifty exhibit spaces for any visitor.</p>

<p><strong>Art Gallery of Ontario</strong> On the edge of Chinatown, the Art
Gallery of Ontario contains over 26,000works of art ranging from 15th century
European paintings to contemporary sculpture and modern Inuit carvings.  Anyone
who enjoys visual art of any kind is sure to find something enjoyable and
interesting within the AGO’s spacious halls and galleries.</p>

<p><strong>Hockey Hall of Fame</strong> The Stanley Cup, jerseys of famous
players, videos of the game’s greatest moments and even a reproduction of a
dressing room for the stars are all here at the Hockey Hall of Fame.  The Hall
has been open for over thirty years, and is a must for any visiting hockey fan.

<p><strong>Black Creek Pioneer Village</strong> Since it first opened in 1960,
Black Creek Pioneer Village has been recreating life in a 19th century farming
community for all who want to see it.  A tinsmith, a printing press and a
waterwheel mill are some of the various sights to see in this quaint and
charming recreation.</p>

<p><strong>Tommy Thompson Park</strong> Tommy Thompson Park, which is located
on a eight mile long peninsula into Lake Ontario, has been designated an
Important Bird Area (IBA), and is home to several large bird populations,
including terns, cormorants, inland gulls and herons.  Other wildlife, such as
rabbits, coyotes, woodchucks and butterflies also make the park their home.
Visitors are free to cycle and walk on the trails, but dogs and other pets are
not allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Metro Toronto Zoo</strong> Containing more than 5,000 animals, six
“zoogeographic regions” and 710 acres, the Metro Toronto Zoo is a world class
attraction to animal lovers and the young at heart.  The zoo is home to such
rare species as the Indian rhinoceros, the pygmy hippopotamus and the lowland
gorilla, not to mention Canada’s largest herd of African elephants.  The zoo
also features a “Zoomobile” which gives tours of the zoo as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Day Cruises</strong> Toronto’s panoramic skyline becomes even more
dramatic when it is seen from the water.  Cruises ranging from a two-hour
harbor tour to an all-day cruise with a shipboard dinner and dancing can be
scheduled, on ships as diverse as enclosed tour boats, three-masted Great Lakes
schooners (<a href="http://www.greatlakesschooner.com" target="_blank">www.greatlakesschooner.com</a>), or even Canada’s tallest sailing ship,
the Empire Sandy (<a href="http://www.empiresandy.com" target="_blank">www.empiresandy.com</a>). For schedules and fares, check
<a href="http://www.harbourfront.on.ca" target="_blank">www.harbourfront.on.ca</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hippo Tours</strong> These amphibious bus tours seat forty and take
passengers on a ninety-minute journey around Toronto, cruising through both
city streets and harbor waves.  The tours leave every hour, on the hour.  More
information can be found at <a href="http://www.torontohippotours.com" target="_blank">www.torontohippotours.com</a>.</p>

<h2>DAY TRIPS</h2>

<p><strong>Niagara Falls</strong> Roughly 80 miles (130 kilometers) from
Toronto, the city of Niagara Falls is a relaxing destination for a day trip
away from the big city.  Boasting more than just its namesake waterfalls, the
“Honeymoon Capital of the World” has many well maintained museums and parks, as
well as shopping casinos and the aquatic park “Marineland”.  Of course, no
visit to Niagara would be complete without seeing the magnificent falls,
especially from the deck of the tour ship Maid of the Mist.  Tours can be
arranged through www.niagarafallstours.net, and more information on the city
can be found at the city’s webpage, <a href="http://www.city.niagarafalls.on.ca" target="_blank">www.city.niagarafalls.on.ca</a>.</p>

<p><strong>African Lion Safari</strong> If the Toronto nightlife isn’t wild
enough for you, the African Lion Safari (<a href="http://www.lionsafari.com" target="_blank">www.lionsafari.com</a>) is only about an
hour from the city, and is sure to thrill the entire family.  The park houses
more than 1000 animals, including lions, elephants, baboons, zebra and more, on
a series of 5 to 50 acre (2 to 20 hectare) reserves.  Guests can either drive
through in their own car or join a guided tour, and there are many animal
performances to enjoy as well.  Fair warning to all tourists: with the petting
zoos, breeding programs and boat and railway tours, you may need more than one
trip to take it all in.</p>

<h2>TIPPING</h2>

<p>Tipping is generally not included in service charges in Canada. The general
rule is to tip 15% of the entire bill. Porters and doormen should get about $2
a bag and maids should receive about $2 per person per day ($3 in luxury
hotels).</p>
