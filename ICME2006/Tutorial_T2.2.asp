<h1>T2.2 Hardware and Software Techniques for Multimedia Systems</h1>

<p><strong>Sunday, July 9, 2006 (13:30 - 16:30, Thomson)</strong></p>

<h4>Instructors</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dutt/">Prof. Nikil Dutt</a>, <em>University of California at Irvine, USA</em><br>
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~wolf/">Prof. Wayne Wolf</a>, <em>Princeton University, USA</em></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>Multimedia systems are high-performance applications that demand the most
out of computing systems. They are often implemented on low-cost or mobile
platforms that put additional constraints on the design of the system. This
tutorial will cover basic concepts and techniques for the design of hardware
and software for multimedia systems.</p>

<p>Multimedia applications stress all the major problems in embedded computing:
real-time responsiveness, low-power operation, and low cost. A variety of
hardware platforms are available to serve as the basis of multimedia systems,
depending on the sales volume, performance requirements, and energy budget of
the projects.  Many software techniques have been developed to optimize the
execution of software for real-time, low-power, and memory-constrained
systems.</p>

<p>Multimedia systems have traditionally relied on hardware because software
could not provide the necessary performance. However, modern multimedia
applications are so complex that they inevitably implement a substantial amount
of software. Furthermore, newer customized programmable and reconfigurable
platforms are emerging that can deliver the desired application performance in
software.  Multimedia algorithm designers need to be aware of the advantages
and limitations of different implementation technologies in order to make the
best algorithmic choices.</p>

<h4>Speaker Biographies</h4>

<p><strong>Nikil Dutt</strong> is professor of computer science and a member of
the Center for Embedded Computer Systems (CECS) at the University of California
at Irvine. He received his PhD in CS from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign in 1989. His research lies at the intersection of compilers,
architectures and computer-aided design, with a specific focus on the
exploration, evaluation and design of domain-specific embedded systems. He is
the author of five books on the topics of high-level synthesis, memory
architecture exploration and functional validation of programmable embedded
systems. He received Best Paper Awards at several conferences (CHDL89, CHDL91,
VLSIDesign2003 and CODES+ISSS 2003) and currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief
of ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES) and as
Associate Editor of ACM Transactions on Embedded Computer Systems (TECS).</p>

<p><strong>Wayne Wolf</strong> is professor of electrical engineering at
Princeton University.  Before joining Princeton in 1989, he was with AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey.  He received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.
degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1980, 1981, and
1984, respectively.  His research interests include  embedded computing, VLSI
systems, and multimedia information systems. He is the author of Computers as
Components, FPGA-Based System Design, and Modern VLSI Design (for which he won
the ASEE Frederick E. Terman Award). Wolf has been elected to Phi Beta Kappa
and Tau Beta Pi.  He is a Fellow of the IEEE and ACM, an IEEE Computer Society
Golden Core Member, and a member of the SPIE and ASEE.</p>
