<h1>Ten Challenging Problems in Content-Based Image end Video Retrieval</h1>

<h3>Date: Wednesday Morning, July 12<br />
Location: TBA</h3>

<h3>Presented by</h3>

<p>T. S. Huang, <em>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</em></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Until recently and even today most information retrieval is based on
keywords.  However, the increasing abundance of multimedia data esp. audio,
images, and video, provides new opportunities and new challenges.  Among the
opportunities is the possibility of searching based on low-level audio-visual
features (such as pitch, energy; color, texture, shape, layout, motion field)
and mid-level features (such as prosody; trajectories) in addition to keywords.
The challenges are many.  Here is my top ten list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bridging the Semantic Gap: How to recognize high-level semantic concepts
  such as indoor or outdoor, face, vehicle, walking or running. This is needed
  for automatic annotation.</li>
  <li>Audio scene analysis: Although much work has been done on visual scene
  analysis, audio scene analysis is still in its infancy.</li>
  <li>Data integrity: How do we know whether the audio or visual data has been
  tampered with?</li>
  <li>Multimedia data mining: How do we search for correlation, anomalous
  patterns, etc. in audio, images and video, text, etc. say on the Web?</li>
  <li>Machine Learning issues: Use of unlabeled training data in Relevance
  Feedback; active learning, incremental learning; building profile of a user
  over time; collective learning.</li>
  <li>Human-computer interfaces: How to best place a human in the loop?</li>
  <li>Close collaboration of researchers in computer vision and audio
  understanding, with researchers in traditional IR and DB (computer science).
  </li>
  <li>Performance evaluation: What are good metrics to evaluate and compare
  retrieval algorithms?</li>
  <li>What are the killer applications?</li>
  <li>Privacy, rights.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this talk, we shall comment briefly on these ten challenges and then
discuss one of them (HCI) in some detail. In particular, a video
indexing/retrieval system based on generative models will be described.</p>

<h3>Speaker Biography</h3>

<p><img src="images/Photo_Huang.jpg" alt="Photo of T. S. Huang" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

<p><strong>Thomas S. Huang</strong> received his B.S. Degree in Electrical
Engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, China; and his
M.S. and Sc.D. Degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was on the Faculty of the
Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT from 1963 to 1973; and on the
Faculty of the School of Electrical Engineering and Director of its Laboratory
for Information and Signal Processing at Purdue University from 1973 to 1980.
In 1980, he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is
now William L. Everitt Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, and Research Professor at the Coordinated Science Laboratory, and
Head of the Image Formation and Processing Group at the Beckman Institute for
Advanced Science and Technology and Co-Chair of the Institute's major research
theme Human Computer Intelligent Interaction.</p>

<p>During his sabbatical leaves: Dr. Huang has worked at the MIT Lincoln
Laboratory, the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and the Rheinishes Landes
Museum in Bonn, West Germany, and held visiting Professor positions at the
Swiss Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne, University of Hannover
in West Germany, INRS-Telecommunications of the University of Quebec in
Montreal, Canada and University of Tokyo, Japan.  He has served as a consultant
to numerous industrial firms and government agencies both in the U.S. and
abroad.</p>

<p>Dr. Huang's professional interests lie in the broad area of information
technology, especially the transmission and processing of multidimensional
signals. He has published 21 books, and over 600 papers in Network Theory,
Digital Filtering, Image Processing, and Computer Vision. He is a Member of the
National Academy of Engineering; a Foreign Member of the Chinese Academies of
Engineering and Sciences; and a Fellow of the International Association of
Pattern Recognition, IEEE, and the Optical Society of American; and has
received a Guggenheim Fellowship , an A.V. Humboldt Foundation Senior U.S.
Scientist Award, and a Fellowship from the Japan Association for the Promotion
of Science . He received the IEEE Signal Processing Society's Technical
Achievement Award in 1987, and the Society Award in 1991. He was awarded the
IEEE Third Millennium Medal in 2000. Also in 2000, he received the Honda
Lifetime Achievement Award for “contributions to motion analysis”. In 2001, he
received the IEEE Jack S. Kilby Medal. In 2002, he received the King-Sun Fu
Prize, International Association of Pattern Recognition; and the Pan Wen-Yuan
Outstanding Research Award. In 2005, he received the Okawa Prize for
Information and Telecommunication Technology. In 2006, he is named "Electronic
Imaging Scientist of the Year" by IS&amp;T and SPIE.</p>

<p>He is a Founding Editor of the International Journal Computer Vision,
Graphics, and Image Processing; and Editor of the Springer Series in
Information Sciences, published by Springer Verlag.</p>

<p>Dr. Huang initiated the first International Picture Coding Symposium in
1969, and the first International Workshop on Very Low Bitrate Video Coding in
1993.  Both meetings have become regular events (held every 12-18 months), and
have contributed to the research and international standardization of image and
video compression. He also (together with Peter Stucki and Sandy Pentland)
initiated the International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture
Recognition in 1995.  This Conference has also become a regular event, and
provides a forum for researchers in this important and popular field.</p>

<p>Current Research Interests:</p>

<p>Multimodal (esp. audio and visual) signal processing, analysis, and
visualization, esp. in the context of Human Computer Interaction.</p>

<p>Image and Video databases:  Low-level content-based image and video
retrieval; relevance feedback, GUI, data mining, event detection.</p>
