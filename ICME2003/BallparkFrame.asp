<h1>ICME 2003 Afternoon at the Ballpark</h1>
<h3>FOCUS ON FUN!</h3>

<p>Oriole Park at Camden Yards<br>
333 W. Camden Street<br>
(Camden and Eutaw Street)</p>

<p>Ever heard of "Babe" George Herman Ruth?  How about Cal Ripken's breaking of 
Lou Gehrig's record (2,130 over 13 years) of most consecutive games played (2,632 
at the end of 1998) or Eddie Murray's 500th homer?  In Baltimore it is the "Birds,"
"dem O's" or "dem Orals."  The pride of Baltimore  -- The Baltimore Oriole Baseball
Team, League Champions.</p>

<p>The ICME 2003 attendees have great seats at the game on Sunday, July 6th at 13:35!  To 
join us, sign up on your ICME registration form or send an email to <a href="mailto:registration@icme2003.com">registration@icme2003.com</a>.  
Along with the wonderful afternoon at the park, you'll receive a gift certificate that will get you great food, drinks, and souvenirs.  
We'll meet at 13:00 - between tutorials -  in the sitting room lobby of the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront across from the elevators by 
the fireplace.  It will be a beautiful walk on the Inner Harbor to "the Yards."</p>
