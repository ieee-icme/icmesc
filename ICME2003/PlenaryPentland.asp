<h2>Human Design: Building Computation around Human Networks</h2>
<h3>July 7, 2003, 1:30-2:30pm</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Humans and machines are interacting ever more closely, and this is
changing both the structure of human organizations and the experience of the
participants.  My research group and I are therefore asking how
technology can enhance the individual in order to produce organizations that are more
creative and efficient, and that better support the individual's personal
experience.</p>

<p>Our work focuses at three scales:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the individual, where we are augmenting people with wearable
computers that
enhance their memory, skills, and situational awareness,</li>
 <li>the group, where we are using wearables and ubiquitous
infrastructure to
engage group social dynamics and expertise, allowing `smart' networks to
support group performance</li>
 <li>the nation, were we are developing active network technologies that
support
social goals such as improved health, learning, and entrepreneurship
We are finding that there is great opportunity for technology to produce
organizations that are more creative and efficient, but also that there
are
dangerous possibilities for intrusion into the individual's personal
life.</li>
</ul>
