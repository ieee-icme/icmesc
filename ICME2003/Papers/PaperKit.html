</P>


<H2>STEP 1: Complete a properly formatted paper document.</H2>
<P>Use the following guidelines when preparing your document:
</P>
<P class="Level2">LENGTH: You are allowed a total of 4 pages for your document. This is the maximum number of pages that will be accepted, including all figures, tables, and references. Any documents that exceed the 4 page limit will be rejected.
</P>
<P class="Level2">LANGUAGE: All proposals must be in English.
</P>
<P class="Level2">MARGINS: Documents should be formatted for standard <B>letter-size (8-1/2" by 11") paper</B>. Documents may not exceed four (4) pages. Any text or other material outside the margins specified below will not be accepted:
	<UL>
		<LI>All text and figures must be contained in a 175 mm x 226 mm (6.9 inch x 8.9 inch) image area.</LI>
		<LI>The left margin must be 19 mm (0.75 inch).</LI>
		<LI>The top margin must be 25 mm (1.0 inch), except for the title page where it must be 35 mm (1.375 inches).</LI>
		<LI>Text should appear in two columns, each 83 mm wide with 8 mm space between columns.</LI>
		<LI>On the first page, the top 50 mm (2") of both columns is reserved for the title, author(s), and affiliation(s). These items should be centered across both columns, starting at 35 mm (1.375 inches) from the top of the page.</LI>
		<LI>The paper abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of text, about 12 mm (0.5") below the title area and no more than 80 mm (3.125") in length. Leave 12 mm (0.5") of space between the end of the abstract and the beginning of the main text.</LI>
	</UL>
	A format sheet with the margins and placement guides is available in the following file formats:
	<UL>
		<LI><A href="PaperFormat/format.pdf">PDF file</A> (Most Accurate. When you print this file, make sure the "shrink to fit" box is not checked!)</LI>
		<LI><A href="PaperFormat/format.ps">PostScript file</A></LI>
	</UL>
	These files contain lines and boxes showing the margins and print areas. If you print one of these files, then stack it atop your printed page and hold it up to the light, you can easily check your margins to see if your print area fits within the space allowed.
</P>
<P class="Level2">TYPEFACE: To achieve the best viewing experience for the review process and conference proceedings, we strongly encourage authors to use Times-Roman font. If a font face is used that is not recognized by the submission system, your proposal will not be reproduced correctly. Use a font size that is no smaller than 9 points throughout the proposal, including figure captions. In 9-point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high. For 9-point type font, there should be no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically. This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make the proposal much more readable. Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger vertical spacing.
</P>
<P class="Level2">TITLE: The paper title has to appear in boldface CAPITAL letters. The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower case letters. Proposals with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information.
</P>
<P class="Level2">ABSTRACT: Each paper should contain an abstract of 100 to 150 words that appears at the beginning of the document. Use the same text that is submitted electronically along with the author contact information.
</P>
<P class="Level2">BODY: Major headings appear in boldface CAPITAL letters, centered in the column. Subheadings appear in capital and lower case, either underlined or in boldface. They start at the left margin of the column on a separate line. Sub-subheadings are discouraged, but if they must be used, they should appear in capital and lower case, and start at the left margin on a separate line. They may be underlined or in italics.
</P>
<P class="Level2">REFERENCES: List and number all references at the end of the document. The references can be numbered in alphabetical order or in order of appearance in the paper. When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence [1].  The end of the document should include a list of references containing information similar to the following example:
</P>
<P class="Level3">[1] D. E. Ingalls, "Image Processing for Experts," IEEE Trans. ASSP, vol. ASSP-36, pp. 1932-1948, 1988.
</P>
<P class="Level2">ILLUSTRATIONS &amp; COLOR: Illustrations must appear within the designated margins. They may span the two columns. If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in the middle or at the bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must be clear in black and white. Since the printed proceedings will be produced in black and white, be sure that your images are acceptable when printed in black and white (the CDROM proceedings will show the colors in your document).  If you would like to produce a separate black and white version of your paper for use in the printed proceedings, please contact the paper submission tech support at: <A href="mailto:papers@icme2003.com">papers@icme2003.com</A>.
</P>
<P class="Level2">PAGE NUMBERS: <B>Do not put page numbers on your document</B>. We will add appropriate page numbers to accepted papers when the conference proceedings are assembled.
</P>
<P>The following style files and templates are available for users of LaTeX and Microsoft Word:
<UL>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/spconf.sty">LaTeX style file with margin, page layout, font, etc. definitions.</A></LI>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/IEEEbib.bst">BiBTeX style file with bibliography style definitions.</A></LI>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/Template.tex">LaTeX template file, an example of using the "spconf.sty" and "IEEEbib.bst" files above.</A></LI>
	<LI><A href="PaperFormat/WordTemplate.doc">Word 97/2000 Sample, a template of correct formatting and font use.</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>We recommend that you use the Word file or LaTeX files to produce your document, since they have been set up to meet the formatting guidelines listed above.  When using these files, double-check the paper size in your page setup to make sure you are using the letter-size paper layout (8.5" X 11").  The LaTeX environment files specify suitable margins, page layout, text, and a bibliography style. Although this environment has been extensively tested, there may be rare instances when it is not fully robust.
</P>

<H2>STEP 2: Submit the paper electronically and copyright form by fax.</H2>
<P>The review process will be performed from the electronic submission of your paper.  To ensure that your document is compatible with the review system, please adhere to the following compatibility requirements:
</P>
<H3>File Format</H3>
<p><b><font color="red">IMPORTANT:</font></b> You <b>MUST</b> follow the IEEE Requirements for PDF Documents exactly. The conference is required to have documents follow this specification. The requirements are enumerated in:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="PaperFormat/IEEEPDFSpecV22.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Requirements for PDF Documents v2.2</a> [PDF]</li></ul>
<P>Papers must be submitted in either PostScript or PDF format. PDF files must not have Adobe Document Protection enabled, as this prevents us from processing the file. These submissions must be formatted to 8.5" x 11" page size, and in first-page-first order. Please verify that the final version of your PostScript or PDF file prints correctly to a PostScript printer before submission. Documents that do not print correctly cannot be reviewed. Also, make sure to disable ALL document security. For best results, authors should avoid the use of custom half tones, bitmap pattern fills, and bitmap fonts. Use standard half tones and solid color or grey fills instead. The paper submission system will convert all papers into Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). If you are able to create a PDF file yourself, you are encouraged to do so. Since reviewers will be viewing a PDF version of your paper, translation errors will be minimized by your submission of a PDF instead of a PostScript, resulting in the best possible rendering of your document. Be sure that you embed all fonts that are used when you create the PostScript or PDF file. For best PDF document quality, you may want to read Adobe's recommendations for generating PostScript and PDF files.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT: You <b>MUST</b> be sure to EMBED ALL FONTS in your PDF or Postscript file. There is no guarantee that the viewers of your paper (reviewers and those who view the proceedings CD-ROM after publication) have the fonts you use in your document. If you do not embed all fonts in your file, you will be contacted by CMS and asked to submit a file that has all font data embedded. Please refer to your PDF or PS file generation utility's user guide to find out how to embed all fonts.
</P>
<P>LaTeX Users: Generating a PostScript file is straightforward for all LaTeX packages we are aware of. When preparing the proposal under LaTeX, it is preferable to use scalable fonts such as Type I, Computer Modern. However, quite good results can be also obtained with the fonts defined in the ICME style file recommended above (spconf.sty).
</P>
<P>Windows users: To save a document as a PostScript file:
<UL>
	<LI>Install and select a PostScript printer driver.  We recommend <A href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvwin.htm">Adobe Systems' PostScript Driver</A>.</LI>
	<LI>In your word processor, on the File menu, click Print.</LI>
	<LI>Select the PostScript printer which will be used to generate the file.</LI>
	<LI>Select the Print to File check box, and then click OK.</LI>
	<LI>In the File name box, type a file name. The file is saved with a '.prn' extension by default. Rename the file to give it the extension '.ps'.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Macintosh users: To save a document as a PostScript file:
<UL>
	<LI>Install and select a PostScript printer driver.  We recommend <A href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvmac.htm">Adobe Systems' PostScript Driver</A>.</LI>
	<LI>In your word processor, on the File>Print menu, click General.</LI>
	<LI>Go down to "Save as File."</LI>
	<LI>Make the following selections:
	<UL>
		<LI>Format: PostScript Job</LI>
		<LI>PostScript Level: Level 1 Compatible</LI>
		<LI>Data Format: ASCII</LI>
		<LI>Font Inclusion: All</LI>
		<LI>Destination: File</LI>
	</UL></LI>
	<LI>Click "Save" and specify a file name.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>File Size Limit</H3>
<P>Authors will be permitted to submit a document file up to 1 MB (megabyte) in size.  To request an exception, contact the paper submission technical support at: <A href="mailto:papers@icme2003.com">papers@icme2003.com</A>
</P>

<H3>Filename</H3>
<P>The filename of the document file should be the first author's last name, followed by the appropriate extension (.ps or .pdf). For example, if the first author's name is Johan Smith, you would submit your file as "smith.ps" or "smith.pdf". To speed transmission of your PostScript and PDF files, you may use a compression utility that will produce compressed archives that are 100% compatible with the ZIP compression format defined by PKWare or the GZip format common on UNIX and Linux systems. Such a utility can be downloaded from PKWare's website at: <A href="http://www.pkware.com">www.pkware.com</A>. This compression is not required, but it is allowed and encouraged so that file transfer times may be reduced. If you do submit a compressed version of the document file, use the same filename specification mentioned earlier, with the appropriate file extension (for example, "smith.zip" or "smith.gz"). The paper submission process will append the filename with a unique identifier when it is stored on our system, so multiple submissions with the same name will not overwrite each other and will be distinguishable.
</P>
<H3>Submission</H3>
<P>When you have your document file ready, gather the following information before entering the submission system:
<UL>
	<LI>Document file</LI>
	<LI>Affiliation, email address, and mailing address for each author</LI>
	<LI>Paper title</LI>
	<LI>Text file containing paper abstract text, in ASCII text format (for copying and pasting into web page form)</LI>
</UL>
<P>To submit your document and author information, go to the following URL:
</P>
<P>
<A href="http://www.icme2003.com/papers/submission.asp">http://www.icme2003.com/papers/submission.asp</A>
</P>
<P>The submission system will present an entry form to allow you to enter the paper title, abstract text, review category, and author contact information.  
</P>
<P>After you submit this information, the system will display a page with the data that you entered so that you may verify its accuracy.  If you need to change the data to fix a mistake, you may use the back button on your browser to return to the information entry form.  Once you approve of the data that you have entered, you may choose your document file for upload at the bottom of the verification page.  When you click on the button labeled 'Continue' at the bottom of this page, the page will check the filename extension to make sure it matches the submission criteria, then your browser will upload your file to our server.  Depending on the size of your file and your internet connection speed, this upload may take a few minutes.  At the end of a successfull upload, you will see a confirmation page displaying the paper number that is assigned to you, and and email message will be sent to the authors' email addresses to confirm that the file has been uploaded.  If you do not see the confirmation page after uploading your file, we may not have successfully received your file upload.  If you encounter trouble, contact the paper submission support at: <A href="mailto:papers@icme2003.com">papers@icme2003.com</A>.
</P>  
<P>The confirmation page that is displayed after uploading your document file will also generate an IEEE copyright form for your paper that you MUST print, sign, and fax to us.  Our fax number will also be provided in the submission system.  If you have difficulty faxing your copyright form, please contact the paper submission support at: <A href="mailto:papers@icme2003.com">papers@icme2003.com</A>.
</P>

<A href="#top">Back to top</A>

<H2>STEP 3: Check the ICME 2003 website for the status of your paper.</H2>
<H3>Review Process</H3>
<P>Your submitted paper will be converted to PDF format by the submission system if necessary, then visually inspected by our submission system staff to assure that the document is readable and meets all formatting requirements to be included in a visually pleasing and consistant proceedings publication for ICME 2003.  If our submission inspectors encounter errors with your submitted file, they will contact you to resolve the issue.  If your paper passes inspection, it will be entered into the review process.  A committee of reviewers selected by the conference committee will review the documents and rate them according to quality, relevence, and correctness.  The conference technical committee will use these reviews to determine which papers will be accepted for presentation in the conference.  The result of the technical committee's decision will be communicated to the submitting authors by email, along with any reviewer comments if there were any.
</P>
<H3>Monitor Your Submission Status</H3>
<P>After you submit your document, you may monitor the status of your paper as it progresses through the submission and review process by using the Paper Status website available at:
</P>
<p><A href="http://www.icme2003.com/Papers.asp">http://www.icme2003.com/Papers.asp</A>
</p>
<H3>Register for the Conference</H3>
<P>Be sure that at least one author registers to attend the conference using the online registration system available through the conference website.  Each paper must have at least one registered author to avoid being withdrawn from the conference.

</P>
<P>If you post an electronic version of an accepted paper, you must provide the IEEE with the electronic address (URL, FTP address, etc.) of the posting.
</P>

<A href="#top">Back to top</A>

<H2>STEP 4: Prepare a lecture or poster presentation.</H2>

<P>When we send the review results for your paper by email, that email message will specify whether accepted papers have been assigned for presentation in a poster session or lecture (oral) session.  To help authors prepare for lecture and poster presentations, the following suggestions have been created:</P>
<H3>Lecture Presentations</H3>
<P>Presentation time is critical: each paper is allocated 16 minutes for oral sessions. We recommend that presentation of your slides should take about 13-14 minutes, leaving 2-3 minutes for introduction, summary, and questions from the audience. To achieve appropriate timing, organize your slides or viewgraphs around the points you intend to make, using no more than one slide per minute. A reasonable strategy is to allocate about 2 minutes per slide when there are equations or important key points to make, and one minute per slide when the content is less complex. Slides attract and hold attention, and reinforce what you say - provided you keep them simple and easy to read. Plan on covering at most 6 points per slide, covered by 6 to 12 spoken sentences and no more than about two spoken minutes.</P>
<P>Make sure each of your key points is easy to explain with aid of the material on your slides. Do not read directly from the slide during your presentation. You shouldn't need to prepare a written speech, although it is often a good idea to prepare the opening and closing sentences in advance. It is <b>very</b> important that you rehearse your presentation in front of an audience before you give your presentation at ICME. Surrogate presenters <b>must</b> be sufficiently familiar with the material being presented to answer detailed questions from the audience. In addition, the surrogate presenter must contact the Session Chair in advance of the presenter's session.</P>
<P>A computer-driven slideshow for use with a data projector is recommended for your talk at ICME. All presentation rooms will be equipped with a computer, a data projector, a microphone (for large rooms), a lectern, and a pointing device. An overhead projector will be provided upon request. If you need any other audio or visual equipment, such as a PAL or NTSC VHS player, or 35mm slide projector, please send a request for such equipment by email to <A href="mailto:papers@icme2003.com">papers@icme2003.com</A>. Such requests must be received by one month before the conference date.  Failure to make prior arrangements may mean that the equipment will not be available to you.</P>
<P>Some of the lecture presentations will be given in quite large lecture halls. We recommend that you prepare your slides according to the following guidelines to ensure that the entire audience will be able to see your presentation. Your Session Chair might contact you in advance of the conference to request copies of your visual aids for approval before the conference.</P>
<P>Transparencies (viewgraphs) should be oriented vertically. Their contents should fit within a rectangle 19cm wide by 23cm high. Lettering: A minimum font (type) size of 24 point (capital letters at least 6mm high) should be used, set in a "sans serif" font (for example "cmss" in the Computer Modern family or the "Helvetica" PostScript font). Spacing: A <B>minimum</B> of 5mm of blank space should be left between lines; more is preferable. Leave as much "white space" as possible to make them easily readable. Following these guidelines, you will easily be able to put as much information on the viewgraph as your audience can absorb in one minute. Remember, you can expand upon some points in your lecture presentation; the viewgraphs need not contain every minor piece of information. It is more important that they be easily readable by the audience.</P>
<P>35mm slides may be formatted either vertically or horizontally. In other respects, slides must conform to the same  standards as set out above for viewgraphs, scaled down appropriately. In particular, the type size should be no smaller than 0.8mm and the line spacing should be at least 0.7mm on the 35mm slide.</P>
<H3>Poster Presentations</H3>
<P>Poster sessions are a good medium for authors to present papers and meet with interested attendees for in-depth  technical discussions. In addition, attendees find the poster sessions a good way to sample many papers in parallel sessions. Thus it is important that you display your message clearly and noticeably to attract people who might have an interest in your paper.</P>
<P>Your poster should cover the key  points of your work. It need not, and should not, attempt to include all the  details; you can describe them in person to people who are interested. The ideal poster is designed to attract attention, provide a brief overview of your work, and initiate discussion. Carefully and completely prepare your poster well in advance of the conference. Try tacking up the poster before you leave for the conference to see what it will look like and to make sure that you have all of the necessary pieces.</P>
<P>For your poster, a board will be provided which measures 120cm tall by 240cm wide (landscape orientation). Push tacks or velcro adhesive will be provided at the conference to mount your poster to the board.</P>
<P>The title of your poster should appear at the top in CAPITAL letters about 25mm high. Below the title put the author(s)' name(s) and affiliation(s). The flow of your poster should be from the top left to the bottom right. Use arrows to lead your viewer through the poster. Use color for highlighting and to make your poster more attractive. Use pictures, diagrams, cartoons, figures, etc., rather than text wherever possible. Try to state your main result in 6 lines or less, in lettering about 15mm high so that people can read the poster from a distance. The smallest text on your poster should be at least 9mm high, and the important points should be in a larger size. Use a sans-serif font (such as "cmss" in the Computer Modern family or the "Helvetica" PostScript font) to make the print easier to read from a distance.</P>
<P>Make your poster as self-explanatory as possible. This will save your efforts for technical discussions. There will not be any summaries given at the beginning of the poster sessions at ICME 2003, so authors need not prepare any overhead slides for their poster presentations. You may bring additional battery-operated audio or visual aids to enhance your presentation.</P>
<P>Prepare a short presentation of about 5 or 10 minutes that you can periodically give to those assembled around your poster throughout the 1 hour 20 minute poster session. To effectively utilize the presentation space, poster sessions will be divided into two halves. Authors will be required to stand by their poster for one of the two halves. The precise half to which each poster is assigned will be indicated in the final program. If possible, more than one author should attend the session to aid in presentations and discussions, and to provide the presenters with the chance to rest or briefly view other posters.</P>
