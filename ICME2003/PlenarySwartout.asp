<h2 style="text-align: left">Making Virtual Humans a Reality: Melding Hollywood Techniques and Simulation Technology</h2>
<h3>July 9, 2003, 1:30-2:30pm<br>Grand Ballroom V</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>How can training simulations be made more effective? An important insight in
answering that question is to recognize that effective training depends both
on the technology that is used to present the material and the content of
the material itself. The Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) was
created at the University of Southern California with the goal of bringing
together researchers in simulation technology to collaborate with people
from the entertainment industry. The idea was that if those who understood
how to create high resolution graphics, immersive sound, and believable
virtual humans worked together with those who understood how to create
compelling stories and characters a synergy would emerge that would allow
them to create much more compelling simulation experiences.</p>

<p>Although the ICT has only been in existence for a short time, we are already
beginning to see some of the results of this collaboration. These are
reflected both in the kinds of projects that the ICT takes on and the
approach that we take to implementing systems. While most military
simulations involve simulating a vehicle such as a tank, an airplane or a
helicopter, ICT¹s simulations put trainees into a human-oriented simulation,
where they interact with real and virtual (computer-generated) humans. While
scenarios in most military simulations tend to proceed in a straightforward
fashion, our scenarios engage the trainee with plot twists, turns and
surprises, much like one might find in a good Hollywood script. In
constructing our simulations we have used a hybrid approach, mixing
different techniques and technologies to produce the best overall effect. In
that way, we are following Hollywood film production techniques where what
appears as a single seamless scene in film may actually be the result of
integrating a large number of disparate elements produced using filmed live
action, computer generated imagery, and models.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will highlight our work on constructing virtual humans --
computer generated characters that use artificial intelligence to reason
about events as they unfold, to interact with trainees in natural language,
and to model emotions in a believable way.  I will describe how our
collaboration with Hollywood has benefited this research, and demonstrate
some of the capabilities of the virtual humans.</p>

<b>Speaker Biography</b>
<p><img src="images/PlenarySwartout.jpg" alt="Photo of William Swartout" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 8px;">
<b>William Swartout</b> is Director of Technology at USC's Institute for
Creative Technologies and one of its founding employees. Dr. Swartout
has been involved in artificial intelligence research for over 25 years.
His particular research interests include intelligent agents, immersive
virtual reality, knowledge-based systems, knowledge representation,
knowledge acquisition and natural language generation. He received his
Ph.D. and M.S. in computer science from MIT and his bachelor's degree
from Stanford University.</p>

<p>At the Institute for Creative Technologies, he leads the Mission
Rehearsal Exercise project, which is creating an immersive virtual
reality environment in which trainees interact with computer generated
virtual humans, who play the part of local civilians and friendly and
opposing forces.  The behavior of the virtual humans is not
pre-scripted, instead they use artificial intelligence to reason about
the events as they unfold and react appropriately. This project received
awards in 2001 for outstanding innovation in modeling and simulation
from the NTSA and took first place for innovative application of agent
technology at the 2001 International Conference on Autonomous Agents.
Dr. Swartout is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial
Intelligence (AAAI), has been elected to the Board of Councilors of the
AAAI and is past chair of the Special Interest Group on Artificial
Intelligence (SIGART) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
He has served as program co-chair for national and international
conferences on artificial intelligence, including the Eighth National
Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-90) and the Third
International Conference on Principles of Knowledge and Reasoning
(KR-92).</p>
