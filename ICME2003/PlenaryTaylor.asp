<h2 style="text-align: left">Computer-Integrated Surgery: Coupling Information to Action in the 21'st Century</h2>
<h3>July 8, 2003, 1:30-2:30pm<br>Grand Ballroom V</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>The impact of Computer-Integrated Surgery (CIS) on medicine in the next 20 years will be as great as that of Computer-Integrated 
Manufacturing on industrial production over the past 20 years. A novel partnership between human surgeons and machines, made possible 
by advances in computing and engineering technology, will overcome many of the limitations of traditional surgery.  By extending 
human surgeons' ability to plan and carry out surgical interventions more accurately and less invasively, CIS systems will address 
a vital national need to greatly reduce costs, improve clinical outcomes, and improve the efficiency of health care delivery.  As 
CIS systems evolve, we expect to see the emergence of two dominant and complementary paradigms: Surgical CAD/CAM systems will integrate 
accurate patient-specific models, surgical plan optimization, and a variety of execution environments permitting the plans to be 
carried out accurately, safely, and with minimal invasiveness. Surgical Assistant systems will work cooperatively with human surgeons 
in carrying out precise and minimally invasive surgical procedures.</p>
<p>The evolution of these systems will be synergistic with the development of patient-specific surgical simulation for planning as 
well as for training and surgical augmentation systems transcending human sensory-motor limitations in the performance of surgical 
tasks.  This presentation will use current research at Johns Hopkins University and elsewhere to illustrate these themes and will 
outline current barriers and opportunities for future developments.</p>

<b>Speaker Biography</b>
<p><img src="images/PlenaryTaylor.jpg" alt="Photo of Russell H. Taylor" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 8px;">Russell H. Taylor received a B.E.S. degree from The Johns Hopkins University in 1970 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford 
in 1976.  He joined IBM Research in 1976, where he developed the AML robot language.  Following a two-year assignment in Boca Raton, 
he managed robotics and automation technology research activities at IBM Research from 1982 until returning to full time technical work 
in late 1988.  From March 1990 to September 1995, he was manager of Computer Assisted Surgery.  In September 1995, Dr. Taylor moved to 
Johns Hopkins University as a Professor of Computer Science, with joint appointments in Radiology and Mechanical Engineering  He is 
also Director of the NSF Engineering Research Center for Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology.  Dr. Taylor has a long 
history of research in computer-integrated surgery and related fields.  In 1988-9, he led the team that developed the first prototype for 
the ROBODOC© system for robotic hip replacement surgery and is currently on the Scientific Advisory Board of Integrated Surgical Systems.  
At IBM he subsequently developed novel systems for computer-assisted craniofacial surgery and robotically-augmented endoscopic surgery.  
At Johns Hopkins, he has worked on all aspects of CIS systems, including modeling, registration, and robotics in areas including percutaneous 
local therapy, microsurgery, and computer-assisted bone cancer surgery.  He is Editor Emeritus of the IEEE Transactions on Robotics and 
Automation, a Fellow of the IEEE and the AIMBE, and a member of various honorary societies, panels, editorial boards, and program committees. 
Dr. Taylor is a member of the scientific advisory board for Integrated Surgical Systems.  In February, 2000 he received the Maurice Müller 
award for excellence in computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery.</p>
