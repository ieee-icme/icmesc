<h2>VISA Requirements</h2>

<p>Complete visa information and the DS-156 application form are available on-line at <http://www.travel.state.gov/visaforms.html>. For further information on obtaining a visa, you may contact any U.S. Consulate Office, or you may check the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs web site at: <http://www.travel.state.gov>. For links to the official Web sites of U.S. posts worldwide, please visit <http://www.travel.state.gov/links.html>.

<p>A citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must usually obtain a visa. The "visitor" visa is a nonimmigrant visa for persons desiring to enter the United States temporarily for business (B-1) or for pleasure (B-2). A consular officer can provide additional information. Travelers from some countries may be able to visit the U.S. without a visa. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables citizens of participating countries to travel to the U.S. for tourism or business for 90 days or less without obtaining a U.S. visa. For more information and to see if your country is a participant in this program, please visit http://travel.state.gov/vwp.html.
</p>
<p>International attendees requiring a visa to visit the United States should contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate nearest them. The visa application process should be initiated well in advance of the estimated departure date.
</p>
<p>For visas, most applicants must have a passport, valid for six months beyond the duration of the proposed visit, and one pass port size photograph. It is helpful for an applicant to have a letter of invitation from the conference. If you need a personal letter of invitation to attend ICME 2003, please contact Miss Stephanie Cantu, Conference Management Services, scantu@cmsworldwide.com. You should provide her with your complete mailing address, email address, and fax number. The letter of invitation with an original signature will be sent to you immediately.
