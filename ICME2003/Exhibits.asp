<h1>Exhibitor's Invitation</h1>
<p><a href="ICME_Exhibitor_Information.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Version</a> of this Exhibitor Information Packet</p>
<p>We cordially invite you to be a part of the International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) that will
be held at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront Hotel in the heart of Baltimore, Maryland, on July 6-9, 2003. The
ICME conference is one of the major forums for multimedia. You will meet with many of your colleagues and
experts in the field, who influence and drive this industry. We expect to attract over 600 professionals to the
conference, with ties to the four sponsoring IEEE Societies (Signal Processing, Computer, Circuits & Systems,
and Communication). This would be an excellent opportunity to present your products to a focused group of
professionals as well as to attract them to work with you.</p>
<p>The exhibits are strategically located adjacent to other conference activities to give you optimal exposure to
the attendees. In addition to listing your company name and booth location in the program, you will be invited
to meet the conference attendees at the ballpark on July 6, 2003.</p>
<p>You may also elect to become an official ICME 2003 supporter for as little as $3,000. In addition to the
acknowledgements in the conference program, your company will be featured on the conference webpage and
on signage at the conference.</p>
