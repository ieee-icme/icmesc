		 Title: <u><strong>"Network Coding for Efficient Multimedia Content Delivery"</strong></u><br/><br/>
		  <i class="STYLE2">With the increasing popularity of multimedia content such as ultra-high definition video, multi-view video, free viewpoint video etc., it is a challenge for network service providers to distribute such high volume content at a high throughput while maintaining the required standard of quality of service. Popular internet applications such as live streaming, IP TV, web conferencing, etc. require delivering high volume multimedia content among multiple receivers. The usage of multicast technologies enables to deliver content to multiple receivers much more efficiently compared to unicast, albeit the question arises, are network resources utilized optimally? <br /><br />

Network Coding is a novel concept of network coding to optimally utilize network bandwidth. This treats information transmitted in a multicast network quite distinctively to the notion of regarding information as fluids. In network coding, information packets are coded at intermediate nodes. This increases the throughput at which information is delivered to receivers in a multicast network and improves the robustness against packet errors and losses. Due to such advantages, it is appealing to utilize network coding in practical networks to enhance network resource utilization and increase the quality of service.
<br /><br />
Incorporating network coding concepts in practical networks has paved the way for a novel area of research in the field of networking. Deploying network coding in a network requires modifying the existing protocols of handling information at network sources, intermediate nodes and receivers. Means of combating packet errors, losses, delays and jitter, which may encounter in real networks, should be taken in to consideration when developing network coding algorithms. Possibilities of exploiting network coding to optimize networks for various applications can be investigated.
Advantages that could be obtained by utilising network coding techniques for multimedia communication are abundant. The increased throughput and robustness enhances high volume multimedia communication for real-time and non-real time applications. Information available at intermediate nodes can be used to enhance peer-to-peer streaming applications. Adaptive and opportunistic network coding can save bandwidth in multimedia streaming applications in shared mediums. Prioritized network coding algorithms can enrich user experience by transmitting content with higher importance with higher priorities. 
<br /><br />
There is a huge potential for network coding to be used in future multimedia communications to better utilise the system resources. In this tutorial we will discuss the concepts behind network coding explaining the motivations and the benefits it can offer for multimedia content delivery. We will further focus on how network coding concepts can be utilized to enhance high volume multimedia communication in wired and wireless communication systems. Further, future research directions and opportunities will be elaborated to encourage possible future research in the area.
