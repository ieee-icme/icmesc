		  Title: <u><strong>"Multimedia Tagging: Past, Present and Future"</strong></u><br/>
		  <br/>
		  <i>The tags have proved to be a very crucial mechanism to facilitate the effective sharing and organization of large scale of multimedia information. As a result, technical developments on intelligent multimedia tagging have attracted a substantial amount of efforts involving experts from information retrieval, multimedia computing and articial intelligence (particularly computer vision). The truly interdisciplinary research has resulted in many algorithmic and methodological developments. Meanwhile, many commercial web systems (e.g., Youtube, Last.fm, Facebook and Flickr) have successfully introduced a variety of toolkits to assist different users in discovering and exploring media content using tags.<br/><br/>

	 <a name="Ambient Media Computation ¨C A Service and Business Level Perspective"></a> 
		 Title: <u><strong>"Ambient Media Computation ¨C A Service and Business Level Perspective"</strong></u><br/><br/>
		  <i>Media evolved from media that can be described as integrated presentation in one form (multimedia). From multimedia, media evolved towards embedding the consumer in a computer graphic generated synthetic world (virtual reality). From this point on, media evolved to the consumers directly exposed to the media in their natural environment, rather than computer interfaces (ambient media). In addition, media will be evolving towards a fully real/synthetic world undistinguishable from pure media integrating human capacity (biomedia or bio-multimedia) somewhere in the very far distant future. The goal is to train and educate participants in new innovative service design for ambient computation. The course will cover potential and possibilities of this new multimedia field and its relation to other trends, such as ubicom, pervasive computation, affective computation, and tangible media. Specific key-concepts of ambient media are developed based on various business case studies.<br/><br/>

		  Title: <u><strong>"Advances in Perceptual Coding of Digital Pictures"</strong></u><br/><br/>
		  <i>Traditional definition of digital picture coding covers compression of visual data in form of both still images and moving or motion pictures or image sequences or videos [1]. Digital picture compression products, systems and applications proliferated over the past two decades, at a pace which had never been witnessed since the pioneering work by Goodall at Bell Labs in 1949 [2], in visual communications and entertainment, including video telephony, video conferencing, digital television (TV) broadcasting including Standard Definition or SD, High Definition or HD and three-dimensional or 3-D video signals, IPTV (Internet Protocol TV), IP CCTV (Closed-Circuits TV), video streaming and on-demand services, PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) for biomedical imaging, satellite imaging, DVD and HD DVD/Blue-ray products, broadband wireless and multimedia communications (click <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('TechnicalProgram_Tutorials_AdvancesInPerceptualCoding.php');" class="styleWithUnderline">

<a name="Human action analysis with 2D and 3D sensors"></a> 
		  Title: <u><strong>"Human action analysis with 2D and 3D sensors"</strong></u><br/><br/>
		  <i>Human action analysis is a critical task and emerging topic in many multimedia applications. In the past few years, there has been a lot of progress in action recognition with conventional 2D video cameras. Effective techniques have been developed to address many challenging issues in real world environments such as dynamic and cluttered background and occlusions. More recently, the availability of commodity depth cameras has brought a new level of excitement to this field. Rapid progress has been made that addresses new technical issues in action recognition with 3D depth cameras. In this tutorial, we introduce the basics for human action analysis, using both regular and depth cameras. The topics cover the action analysis using depth cameras, action and abnormal event detection in surveillance videos, as well as action analysis in user-generated consumer videos, such as movies and Youtube videos.<br/><br/>

		 Title: <u><strong>"Network Coding for Efficient Multimedia Content Delivery"</strong></u><br/><br/>
		  <i>With the increasing popularity of multimedia content such as ultra-high definition video, multi-view video, free viewpoint video etc., it is a challenge for network service providers to distribute such high volume content at a high throughput while maintaining the required standard of quality of service. Popular internet applications such as live streaming, IP TV, web conferencing, etc. require delivering high volume multimedia content among multiple receivers. The usage of multicast technologies enables to deliver content to multiple receivers much more efficiently compared to unicast, albeit the question arises, are network resources utilized optimally? <br /><br />

Network Coding is a novel concept of network coding to optimally utilize network bandwidth. This treats information transmitted in a multicast network quite distinctively to the notion of regarding information as fluids. In network coding, information packets are coded at intermediate nodes. This increases the throughput at which information is delivered to receivers in a multicast network and improves the robustness against packet errors and losses. Due to such advantages, it is appealing to utilize network coding in practical networks to enhance network resource utilization and increase the quality of service.(click <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('TechnicalProgram_Tutorials_NetworkCoding.php');" class="styleWithUnderline">

		  Title: <u><strong>"Learning and Mining with Visual Data on the Web"</strong></u><br/><br/>
		  <i>Increasingly rich and large-scale image related data are being posted to social network and media sharing websites. Researchers from multidisciplinary areas, including machine learning, computer vision, data mining, and human machine interaction, are developing methods for various applications. This tutorial provides an overview of representative recent advances in this arena of opportunities and challenges. <br/><br/>

First, we discuss Web 2.0 which gave rise to the enormous amount of visual data on the Web. Next, we describe a new computational machinery, Patch Alignment Framework (PAF), which was proposed to unifying various manifold learning based dimension reduction algorithms. Second, we review the recently popular data driven approaches that extends PAF for various settings, such as non-negative data analytics, sparse learning, multiview learning, transfer learning and active learning. Finally, we give example applications of PAF and its variants.
