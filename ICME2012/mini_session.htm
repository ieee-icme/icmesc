<p><strong>Alejandro Jaimes-Larrarte</strong> <i>is researcher at Yahoo! Research Barcelona where he manages the Social Media Engagement group. His technical research focuses on understanding human behavior (in the widest sense) through interdisciplinary approaches and making the knowledge gained useful in the research, development, and deployment of new applications and technologies. This means a strong focus on data analysis considering the role of technology in business and society, and drawing from work in the humanities, information and social sciences (anthropology, psychology, etc.). What brings it all together is my fascination with data and pattern analysis considering the "big picture" (socio-economic and cultural factors). Part of my work focuses on thinking about and developing the foundations of human-centered computing. His work on social media covers 3 areas: data science [social network analysis, user modeling], user experience [interaction models, multimedia, design], and business [visualization, web analytics].<br/>

<p><strong>Gerald Friedland</strong> <i>is a senior research scientist at the International Computer Science Institute, a private lab affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, where he leads multimedia content analysis research, mostly focusing on acoustic techniques as an aid for video analysis. He is currently leading a group of multimedia researchers supported by NSF, DARPA, IARPA, and industry grants. Gerald has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles in conferences,  journals, and books and is currently authoring a new textbook on multimedia computing together with Dr. Ramesh Jain. Gerald co-founded the IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing and is a proud founder and program director of the IEEE International Summer School on Semantic Computing at UC Berkeley.  He is associate editor for ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications, is in the organization committee of ACM Multimedia 2011, 2012, and 2014. He is also serves as TPC Co-Chair of IEEE ICME 2012. He is the recipient of several research and industry recognitions, among them the European Academic Software Award and the Multimedia Entrepreneur Award by the German Federal Department of Economics. Most recently, he lead the team that won the ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge in 2009. Gerald received his doctorate (summa cum laude) and master's degree in computer science from Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.<br/>

<p><strong>Tao Mei</strong> <i>is a Researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. His current research interests include multimedia information retrieval and computer vision. In particular, he is interested in applying the techniques from these areas to a broad range of multimedia applications, such as advertising, social networking, and mobile applications. He is the author of over 100 publications in these areas, and holds 30+ granted U.S. patents and pending applications. He received the best paper awards from ACM Multimedia 2007/9, the best poster paper award from MMSP 2008, and Microsoft Gold Star award in 2010. URL: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tmei/
