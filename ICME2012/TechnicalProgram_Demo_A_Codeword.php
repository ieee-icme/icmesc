<p> <strong>A Codeword Visualization Tool for Dense Trajectory Feature</strong>
</p>


<p>Abstract: Bag of Words model is one of the most popular approaches to various classification tasks. Visualizing codewords can help us deeply understand the discriminative power of each feature in the model. In practice, it is difficult to visualize codewords, especially in case of motion feature because the codebook size is often very large. In this demo, we introduce a codeword visualization tool for the dense trajectory motion feature. Our visualization software is based on userâ€™s interest points, where the end user can select a specific codeword and see how that codeword appears in the video dataset.</p>
