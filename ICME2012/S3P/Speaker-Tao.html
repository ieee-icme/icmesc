<strong>Title:</strong> User Understanding from Social Media
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p><i>People are contributing massive social media contents for knowledge sharing anytime and anywhere. Understanding users from social media therefore becomes important. There are four elements in the loop of understanding a user: user profile, context, multi-modal input, and interactivity. This talk will introduce recent advances for understanding these key elements by leveraging machine intelligence and natural user interaction. Specifically, we will introduce: 1) how to predict user attributes from the heterogeneous forms of data by machine learning techniques, 2) how to leverage context information for personalized recommendation and easy task completion, 3) how to analyze multi-modal user input by media content analysis, and 4) the design principles for natural user interaction. We will also showcase recently developed applications of this kind.
