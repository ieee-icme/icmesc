<strong>Title:</strong> Social Network Analysis, and People Analytics in Social Networks
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p><i>Network as a new scientific discipline is emerging. All kinds of entities -- people, information, societies, nations, devices – are connected to each other and form intertwined networks. Social-informatic networks are becoming part of our daily life. Researchers from multiple disciplines -- electrical engineering, computer science, sociology, economy, management, politics, laws, arts, physics, math, etc – are interacting with each other to build up common grounds of network science. In this course, we will introduce technologies and applications of analyzing the dynamics, behaviors, and structures of complex networks.<br/><br/>

In addition, we will focus on people analytics in such complex networks. People rely on a personal network of friends and colleagues to get trusted information; help filter and interpret information; and get referrals to other people. Moreover, to build such networks, people may leverage multiple means of interaction, such as email, face-to-face meetings, friending activities, and etc. These multi-faceted signals about people give ample opportunities to understand their behavior. SmallBlue, is an info-social sensing, analysis and visualization system designed to unlock this valuable collective intelligence without explicit human involvement. It has been deployed within IBM in over 70 countries for four years, and inferred the social networks of 400,000 employees. We will introduce SmallBlue system and describe how it successfully fostered collaborations in social networks. We will also discuss SmallBlue’s scientific advances, including studies of information spread, social correlation and culture factor in organizational social networks.<br/><br/>

This course will be valuable for students and researchers pursuing advanced understanding in signal processing within complex networks. For its interdisciplinary nature, it is also suitable for students and researchers in other disciplines conducting researches in various forms of networks.
