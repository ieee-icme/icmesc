<strong>Title:</strong>Recent Development of Bag-of-feature Model in Visual Recognition
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p><i>In the past several years, the Bag-of-feature model has achieved great success in visual recognition and become the state of the art. Many new methods and approaches have been proposed, contributing to different components of this model. This presentation covers the fundamentals and the recent development of the Bag-of-feature model in visual recognition. In particular, it focuses on the three key components: codebook generation, coding scheme, and pooling method. For codebook generation, this presentation will briefly review a variety of methods developed so far, including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, random forest, information theoretic optimization, and compact codebooks. On coding scheme, we will see the progress from the simplest hard assignment, through soft assignment, to the more advanced sparse coding techniques. For pooling method, this presentation will discuss the sum-pooling and max-pooling, and present the recent effort on understanding the mechanism of max-pooling. Through these, we will experience how the Bag-of-feature model develops out of its initial form and turns out to be an efficient and powerful visual recognition model.
