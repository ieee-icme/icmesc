<strong>Title:</strong>Social Media Cloud Computing and Social Media Recommendation
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p><i>Today's Internet has witnessed the rapid convergence of online social network service and online multimedia service - a massive number of heterogeneous multimedia contents are shared among users in the online social network. The unique patterns of how multimedia contents are generated, distributed and consumed, and the large-scale, dynamic and complex social network topology impose great challenges for social multimedia applications. To realize the potential of social multimedia, these challenges need to be addressed. This talk first presents the concept and framework of social multimedia cloud computing, and then discusses the design space of the infrastructure/platform services and social multimedia applications. Last, we will use social media recommendation as an application example to present interest-oriented social media recommendation and influence-oriented social media recommendation.
