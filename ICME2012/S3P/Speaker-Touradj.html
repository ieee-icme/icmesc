<strong>Title:</strong> Trust modeling in social tagging
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p><i>This lecture starts by providing an overview of background issues in social networks and in particular social media in order to deal with the issue of trust and security in social tagging. It continues with specific examples and illustrations of security and privacy in social networks. We then discuss various approaches in order to define and implement trust models. The problem of social tagging and tag propagation is then discussed, together with implications in terms of security in such applications. Application of various trust models in social tagging is then described and results analyzed in terms of performance. The issue of how to evaluate social media tools in general and trust models in particular in social networks is then discussed. The lecture concludes with an overview of trends and challenges in trust and security issues in social media and in particular in tag propagation.
