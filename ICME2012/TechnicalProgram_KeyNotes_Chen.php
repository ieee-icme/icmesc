<p>  <i> <strong> Mobile Multimedia Meet Cloud: Challenges and Future Directions</strong>
</i></p>


<p><i><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</i></p>
<p><i>Smart phones and tablets are becoming the most desired platforms for ubiquitous multimedia services. When this contemporary trend of mobile media meets the increasing availability of public Clouds, a new technical paradigm, Cloud Mobile Media, is now emerging. This new paradigm presents numerous challenges for researchers to develop next generation cloud-driven media services for omnipresent mobile users. This talk shall identify several major challenges in cloud-centric mobile media in properly discovering and seamlessly transporting the user desired media contents in their most appropriate form between the ubiquitous cloud infrastructures and the heterogeneous mobile devices. In particular, key factors that impact the cloud mobile media services, including service latency, user experience, mobility management, energy efficiency, and content security, will be examined. This talk shall also outline some future research directions to further advance this emerging cloud mobile media by overcoming technical barriers resulting from the mismatch between resource abundant cloud infrastructures and severely resource limited mobile devices.
