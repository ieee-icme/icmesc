<p> <strong> A Demonstration of A Hierarchical Multi-Layout 3D Video Browser</strong>
</p>


<p>Abstract: The 3D Video Browser (3VB) enables interactive search within a single video as well as video collections byÂ utilizing 3D projection and an intuitive interaction. The browsing approach is based on hierarchical search, which means that the user can split a video into several segments. The 3VB disposes a convenient interface that allows flexible arrangement of video segments in the 3D space. It allows for concurrent playback of video segments and flexible inspection of these segments at any desired level of detail through convenient user interaction.
