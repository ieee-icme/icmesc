Title: <strong><u>"Advances in Perceptual Coding of Digital Pictures"</u></strong><br/><br/>

<i>
Traditional definition of digital picture coding covers compression of visual data in form of both still images and moving or motion pictures or image sequences or videos [1]. Digital picture compression products, systems and applications proliferated over the past two decades, at a pace which had never been witnessed since the pioneering work by Goodall at Bell Labs in 1949 [2], in visual communications and entertainment, including video telephony, video conferencing, digital television (TV) broadcasting including Standard Definition or SD, High Definition or HD and three-dimensional or 3-D video signals, IPTV (Internet Protocol TV), IP CCTV (Closed-Circuits TV), video streaming and on-demand services, PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) for biomedical imaging, satellite imaging, DVD and HD DVD/Blue-ray products, broadband wireless and multimedia communications.
<br/><br/>
Human visual system (HVS) based perceptual picture (including images and videos) coding research and development has been an important and very challenging topic in both theory and practice since the very beginning [3].  Its importance, relevance and urgency have become increasingly obvious to research and professional communities and industries in order to develop future generations of high quality picture coding standards, products, systems and applications such as super- or ultra-high definition (SHD or UHD) imaging and video systems, digital cinema distribution systems, 3-D video/TV, immersive interactive visual systems, medical imaging and picture archiving systems for telemedicine/telehealth applications, and quality multimedia systems and services.  It is high time that the visual communication services and entertainment should be transformed from the "best efforts" to quality assured practice for the associated industries to be sustainable in the long run.
<br/><br/>
This tutorial will cover theoretical origin and premise of HVS based perceptual picture coding, trace the historical and up-to-date developments of philosophy, approaches/methods, techniques and milestones in perceptual coding of digital pictures, focus on discussions of a number of more recent research developments and publications on the topic, including first hand research investigations conducted by the presenters and their team, and highlight a number of theoretical and practical challenges of this fascinating area in a field of engineering and technology which has been transforming our way of life [4].
<br/><br/>
Discussions on theoretical origin and premise of perceptual picture coding are developed around three fundamental concepts/issues, i.e., information entropy [5] and perceptual entropy [6], statistical redundancies reduction and psychovisual redundancies reduction, and conventional rate-distortion optimization and rate-perceptual-distortion optimization [3].  The overview of perceptual coding of images and videos examines the approaches and the frameworks introduced for perceptual picture coders to date, identifying gaps in relation to perceptually lossless and perceptually lossy coding, perceptual coding of monochrome and colour images, and intra-frame and inter-frame or inter-view video coding.  Challenges and issues requiring inter-disciplinary research efforts will be raised including HVS modeling and adaptation to digital picture compression and processing, suitable and/or new mathematical framework for HVS modeling used in both picture quality assessment and compression engine, standard practice for large sample supra-threshold subjective tests and database setting reference picture quality scales in terms of JND (just noticeable difference) levels or steps, quantitative definition of perceptual entropy and theoretical lower bound for perceptually lossless digital picture compression. 
<br/><br/>
The tutorial aims at providing the participants with a comprehensive treatment and knowledge of perceptual (i.e., HVS based) picture coding and compression, discussing formulations of perceptual picture coders which have been reported in recent years, and highlighting a number of critical issues and challenges for the next generation high quality picture coding systems and applications.

Brief Biography:<br/>
<strong><a name="K. R. Rao">K. R. Rao:</a></strong> Prof.K. R. Rao received the Ph. D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque in 1966. He received B.S. E.E from the college of engineering, Guindy, India in 1952.Since 1966, he has been with the University of Texas at Arlington where he is currently a professor of electrical engineering. He, along with two other researchers, introduced the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in 1975 which has since become very popular in digital signal processing. DCT, INTDCT, directional DCT and MDCT (modified DCT) have been adopted in several international video/image/audio coding standards such as JPEG/MPEG/H.26X series and also by SMPTE (VC-1)and by AVS China. He is the co-author of the books "Orthogonal Transforms for Digital Signal Processing" (Springer-Verlag, 1975), Also recorded for the blind in Braille by the Royal National Institute for the blind. "Fast Transforms: Analyses and Applications"(Academic Press, 1982), "Discrete Cosine Transform-Algorithms, Advantages, Applications" (Academic Press, 1990). He has edited a benchmark volume, "Discrete Transforms and Their Applications" (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1985). He has co edited a benchmark volume, "Teleconferencing" (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1985). He is co-author of the books, "Techniques and standards for Image/Video/Audio Coding" (Prentice Hall) 1996 "Packet video communications over ATM networks(Prentice Hall) 2000 and "Multimedia communication systems" (Prentice Hall) 2002. He has co edited a handbook "The transform and data compression handbook," (CRC Press, 2001). Digital video image quality and perceptual coding, (with H.R. Wu) (Taylor and Francis 2006). Introduction to multimedia communications: applications, middleware, networking, (with Z.S. Bojkovic and D.A. Milovanovic), Wiley, (2006). He has also published a book, "Discrete cosine and sine transforms", with V. Britanak and P. Yip (Elsevier 2007). Wireless Multimedia Communications (publisher: Taylor and Francis) Nov. 2008. "Fast Fourier Transform: algorithms and Applications", with D. Kim and J.J. Hwang (publisher: Springer) 2010. (Also e-book). Also into Chinese by China Machine Press. Also Asian edition (paper back) by Springer India. Also into Korean by A-Jin publishing company. Some of his books have been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Russian and also published as Asian (paperback)editions(also as e-books). The book "Audio visual coding standard: AVS China and comparison with H.264, VC-1 and DIRAC", (with D. Kim and J.J. Hwang) is under contract with Springer, Expected date of publication, Dec. 2012. He has been an external examiner for graduate students from universities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and USA. He was a visiting professor in several Universities -3 weeks to 7 and 1/2 months- (Australia, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Thailand). He has conducted workshops/tutorials on video/audio coding/standards worldwide. He has supervised several students at the Masters (80) and Doctoral (31) levels. He has published extensively in refereed journals and has been a consultant to industry, research institutes, law firms and academia. He has been a plenary/keynote speaker in several International Conferences (all expenses paid). He has reviewed 23 book manuscripts for book publishers. His research has attracted thirty three visiting professors from Australia, Canada, China, Japan,Korea, Hong Kong, Hungary, Slovakia, Thailand, USSR, and Yugoslavia for periods ranging from 3 weeks to five years (all fully funded by their Universities or foundations). He is a Fellow of the IEEE. He is a member of the Academy of Distinguished Scholars, UTA. He was invited to be a panellist of Electrical Engineering Panel for the 2011 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).
